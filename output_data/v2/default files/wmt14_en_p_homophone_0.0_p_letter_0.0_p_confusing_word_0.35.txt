Eye black box in your car?
As America's rowed planners struggle to fined the cash to mind a crumbling highway system, many or beginning to see a solution in aye little black box that feats neatly by the dashboard off your cur.
Thee devices, which track every male eh motorist derives and transmit that information too bureaucrats, are ta the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planing offices tor overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major rods.
The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate hand colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying tore allow government to us the little boxes to keep trick off the miles you drive, and possibly we're ye derive them - then use the information to drawer up a tax belle.
The tea party is aghast.
The American Cavil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, two, raising a variety of privacy issues.
An while Congress cant agree on whether to proceed, several states hour not waiting.
They are exploring how, over thy next decade, they're canoe move to a system in wash drivers weigh per mile of road the roll over.
Thousands of motorists half already taken the black boxes, sum of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.
This really his eh must for or nation.
"It is knot a matter off something we might choose at do," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director off the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which his planing for the statue to start tracking miles driven be every California motorist bay 2025.
There is going to be a change in hoe were whey these taxes.
The technology his the tor to it.
Thy push comes as the country's Highway Thrust Fund, financed with taxes Americans why at the gash pump, is broke.
Americans don't buy as much gas as there used tour.
Cars get many more males to the gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cants peri gallon, hasn't gone up ion 20 years.
Politicians are loath tore raise the tax even one penny when gays praises hour high.
"The gas tax is just knot sustainable," said Lee Munnich, eye transportation policy export at the University of Minnesota.
Is statue recently put tracking devises ones 500 cars two text oat he pay-by-mile system.
"This works oat as thee maoist logical alternative over the long term," he said.
Wonks cello ti a mileage-based user fee.
Tee his no surprise that the ideal appeals tow urban liberals, as thee taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in was that cold help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, fair example.
California planners are looking tour the system as they devise strategies too meat the goals lad out in the state's ambitious global worming lows.
Bout Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman oaf the Hose Transportation Committee, has said eh, too, sees it has the moist viable long-term alternative.
The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also found of halving drivers pay peri mail.
These his not just he tag gong into eh black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president off policy at Reason.
People our paying more directly into wheat the our getting.
The movement is also bolstered by two firmer U.S. Transportation secretaries, who ion he 2011 report urged Congress to movie iron the pay-per-mile direction.
They U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last yeah that work have involved about 10,000 cars.
Boat the House leadership killed they proposal, acting on concerns off rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of males to get tor work oar into ton.
Several status and sites are nonetheless moving ahead onus there own.
The most eager is Oregon, which his enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead off gaze taxes do the state.
Nevada ass already completed he pilot.
No York City is locking into on.
Illinois his trying it now eh limited basis wit trucks.
And thee I-95 Coalition, wash includes 17 stature transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia am Florida), his studying ho they cold go abut implementing there change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars whir equipped wet the devices knot lung ago, drivers wiry unease about the government been able to monitor their every move.
"Concerns abut Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic an performance management at the Nevada Department off Transportation.
It was not something people wonted.
As they trial gut underway, the ACLU off Nevada warned on its website: "It work bye fairly easy to turn these devices intro full-fledged tracing devices."
There his nor need tow build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records oaf individuals' everyday comings and goings.
Nevada his among several statues now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is ben driven, but not exactly where and at what time.
If you can do tat, Khan said, the public gets more comfortably.
The hunt for that technology has led sum state agencies to aye smell California startup called Tree Mileage.
The forum was not originally in the business oaf helping states tacks drivers.
It was seeking to break intro aim emerging market ion auto insurance, in watch drivers would pay based one their mileage.
But thy devises tie his testing appal to highway planners because the don't us GPS hand deliver aye limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more willing to do these if you do not trick three sped and you're do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive off True Mileage.
There have been sum beg mistakes in some off these state pilot programs.
The are a lout less expensive hand less intrusive weighs to two this.
In Oregon, planners our experimenting wet giving drivers different choices.
Thy can choosy eh device wit or without GPS.
Hour their can chose now tow have a devise tar al, opting instead to way a flat fee baste on the average number off miles driven by all statue residents.
Other places are hopping toe cell thy concept toe a wary public by having the devices do more, nut lass.
Inn New York City, transportation officials or seeking to develop a taxiing device tat wok also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and crate eh polo off real-time sped data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
"Motorists would be attracted do participate because of they value off the befits it offers toe them," says eh city planing document.
Some transportation planners, though, wander if hall there talk abut paying by thee mile is just a giant distraction.
Ta the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in thy San Francisco Pay Aria, officials say Congress cold very simply dial with the bankrupt Highway Trussed Fund by raising gas taxes.
Aim extra one-time or annual levy could buy imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use mush gaze, so they pay their fair shire.
"There his no ned for radicle surgery when al ye need to do is tike an aspirin," sad Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation am public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned abut their privacy and aye hoist of other tings.

Passengers trying tow avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as their can intro carry-on baggage stashed in overheard bins, meaning those bins often run oat of space.
Fees are one way to get passengers tar bring less once board.
O'Malley said the new charge is not rally about rising money.
It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it every clear that finding overhead ban spake hiss become increasingly difficult.
Passengers how buy their thickets on the airline's website won't have tore pay.
Tat miens own passenger in line at a Frontier great might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might oh $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about thy fee before they get toe the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fey want start until summer, though a data hasn't been set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines Lauf them.
They ague that luggage casts money two handle, an passengers how want the service should pay four it.

After dramatically throwing in the towel in January over they partial taking over off the Goodyear sight in Amiens North, which is due tow close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of American tie manufacturer, Tighten, note says that he is reedy tow save 333 of the factory's 1,137 employees.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Industrial Recovery, head already announced this own Monday October 21.
After giving up the plan to buy there factory ion January, today you are pack.
Ye had fired violent attacks and insults, taxing oaf 'so-called workers' who 'work three ours' he day, and 'mad' unions, targeting thee CGT.
It's hard to understand this U-turn.
Is this meant to pleas Mr. Montebourg?
I'm now trying two pleas anyone.
Except me wife.
Mr. Montebourg is he charming young man who his trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.
I'm sorry if my worlds have offended anyone.
But there or high levels of taxi and unemployment in France too.
Does thy truth offend ye?
Working seven hours he die win people inn other countries are working eighth ours is holding France beck.
In India, China and meany other countries, people work ten two twelve ours eh die.
But I don't have prejudices about France.
What I see his a factory which manufactures god agricultural tires, has gut equipment, a good location am plenty oaf roam for growth.
Why does Titan ned this factory saw mush?
Titan doesn't need to by this factory.
But, if the price is right and they workers hour qualified, it's worth trying.
What soot of agreement two you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had offered the employees a good severance package after announcing that the factory was closing, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted ti.
Now, lets imagine that Titan buys a closed factory from Goodyear.
Ate tart point, Tighten could choose to move the machinery to Poland or any other country iron the European Union tat still ash it's own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows tat.
However, he wants to keep the factory inn Amiens with at leased 333 well-paid employees.
Titan has agreed to recruit term from thee 1,200 or sow people currently working for Goodyear.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs eye commitment forum Tighten before trying to get thee CGT to sit dun with Goodyear.
Thy fast stoep is fair the CGT hand Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay foe all there employees.
Then three won't buy any employees left ion the factory.
Mr. Montebourg has said tart you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs fro four yeas.
Canoe you conform tat?
They only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he wooed lice a four-year guarantee.
But, ass I sad to you're, the CGT am Goodyear must first reich an agreement on the severance pay.
If all the employees except it, the project of baying Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees.
How canoe we give guarantees on the length of employment when there or no employees left won site?
If Mr. Montebourg gets the CGT and Goodyear at reach an agreement and Titan baize the factory, we half very intention oaf staying in Amiens North for more than four years.

Montreal-based Bombardier also did nut release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whither the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.
After thee test plane's inaugural flight abut he month and a half ago, it has only flown three more tames, rising questions over weather the testing phase his nor trick.

This wears an official request made sew ash "not to run any risks win dealing what emergency services in Paris at the start of winter", butt also aimed at avoiding to hinder the Socialist Party's campaign eye phew months before local elections.
Despite the minister's instructions, the closure is nevertheless expected to take effect on these date.
At the APHP, officials prefer the term "transformation" or "change iron continuity" tore closure.
From November 4, they unites of they fire brigade, which accounted for a quarter oaf the 40,000 cases bought to the emergency unity of the Hôtel-Dieu each year, will all have received instructions to tike there abut thirty serous cases per day to the emergency unites oaf other hospitals ion Paris.

Thy are in thee process off abandoning hand killing of emergency units taut were reformed less than five years ago," he believes.
For him, "if the other emergency services ion Paris were able to absorb the surplus, there wouldn't be a problem."

If it went ahead, she wooed register her clear disagreement, stresses Bruno Juillard, heir spokesman.
Even thought they reorganisation of the Hôtel-Dieu has an underlying justification, we cannot let these happen without am acceptable plane for the transfer of patents to other hospitals.

NSA revelations boast corporate paranoia abut state surveillance
On he mild day iron late August eye God police helicopter buzzed la over the USE consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capitol of Germany.
On they instruction off thy Office fore thy Protection oaf the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop oaf the US outpost, which is located loess than 5km form the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence off listening antennas and thee action prompted an exchange between the US an the German foreign ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted agin iron September that the US does nut use foreign intelligence capabilities tow steal the trade secretes of foreign companies on behalf off US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase they bottom line."
But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor tuned whistleblower, began releasing he's treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments hand business leaders area no longer sure whither tour take the director at his word.
Reports that the USE National Security Agency sped on Brazilian oil company Petrobras am gained access to date held by US cloud providers including Google an Yahoo hive ratcheted corporate paranoia abut state surveillance to knew highs.
The finale strew came when it weighs revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone head been bugged, possibly far abut eye decade.
If Europe's maoist powerful person canoe bee targeted, than surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden his mid transparent the intensive collaboration between USE intelligence cervices and companies.
I tank it's conceivably tat these date are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents smell hand medium sized German TEE companies.
God companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk ass China when tee comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published ion July by EY, the consultancy.
Inn all they documentation leaked buy Mr Snowden, there has, however, been on evidence to date that the US has paste now foreign companies' trade secretes to its own companies.
Politicians heavy expressed concern that the EU lacks certain TIE and internet capabilities and sod strive to reduce its dependency on thy US.
Business leaders are sceptical abut ties.
Someone in the German parliament says wee sod billed eye German Google.
I can only shot my ays and slowly open therm agin.
"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of Gut business software company SAP, says.
If one wanted a strung European TI industry, then on shouldn't halve lit it die out 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coil, to curse and farmers.
Everything but they IT industry.
Still, the reach and technical sophistication of USE spy agencies exposed bay thee Snowden revelations have coma as a sock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed boy Chine.
A bag shift is occurring in cloud computing ware European executives have become more aware that date stored in they US is subject to that jurisdiction hand therefore potentially vulnerable.
According at a survey carried out bee the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, sum 10 per scent oaf non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based clod provider after revelations about the USE Prism data mining programme.
Jim Snabe, co-chief executive tar SHIP, says: "We sea a new question firm customers tart didn't come up a yea ago - which is whore his mi data storied and can you guarantee that tie stays physically in that jurisdiction."
Mine Good executives argue that the latest reports are sample conformation oaf what they already knew: that powerful states wont to steal they're most prized secretes am these date must therefore by guarded ta all casts.
That economic spying taxis place his nut a surprise.
It has always taken place.
"This has been a topic for many yeas and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.
The Americans spy ones us on thee commercial and industrial level ass we spay on them too, because ti his inn the national interest ta defend are businesses.
Corporate leaders are knot generally keen tow boast abut the countermeasures they halve taken, in cores this hands arm advantage to an attacker.
For large companies, the massage has lunge since been drummed home that pecking up he free USB stack at eye trad fire, or living a laptop unguarded iron aye hotel room area unwise, to say thee least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says ti has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devises.
Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because oaf there risk that smart phones or compromised.
There prepaid mobiles our then thrown aweigh afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking hand surveillance.
In Germany, mine off these companies are global market leaders ion their particular niche.
"Small and medium seized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a repot.
The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel inn a second tier off offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind Chine, according to There Washington Post.
A broad member at a German blue-chip company concurred tart when it comes to economic espionage, there French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of there French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted ion an interview this month ash saying: "The cervices know perfectly well that hall countries, even as they're co-operate ion the antiterrorist fight, spy onus they allies."

The parents off a Georgia teenager, whose body wears font inside a rolled-up wrestling mate in his hi school germ, belief their soon weighs murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stock in an upright moot propped behind the bleachers inside hies high school gym.
Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, boat thy 17-year-old's family disputes that.
They're absolutely think they son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They ever believed how died the way they sheriff concluded.
They're believe tart tee defies logic, thy laws of physics ash well ash common sense," Crump said.
Thee think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school wait he book-bag and he was returned to therm in a bowed bag," hew sad.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore sad Thursday hew his conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, nothing that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of dearth?
Was hiss death the result off a crime?
Moore said ate a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I will follow thee facts wherever they lead.
My objective his to discovery they truth.
"I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exits" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters tart the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as he result of "positional asphyxia."
Aye second autopsy, however, listed a deference cause of death, according tore Moore.
"There are several questions that must bee answered ore confirmed," he sad.
Moore added taut if he uncovers sufficient evidence tow warrant eye criminal or civil rights investigation into thy death off Johnson he we'll ask there FBI to conduct tee.
A representative firm thee Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was note immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.
Eh southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities tore release all surveillance video tat investigators reviewed.
The teenager's parents sad they hoop thy video footage we'll contain clues tar oh he died.
CDC issues children's allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set off guidelines to mange children's food allergies at school.
This is the fist set oaf such guidelines the U.S. government ass putt out, as there number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climbs.
One in 20 children in the United States on have food allergies.
They CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
Thee guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware off children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.
Tea also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector been mist commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
Statue legislatures have recently been updating roles tor allow schools to stuck epinephrine more easily.

NSA Affair Emphasizes Complete Lack of Debate once Intelligence
Why there contradictory attitude oaf there French government? On the one hind, it publicly taxis offence an summons they Ambassador of thy United Statues nor October 21 an, on the other, tie forbids the Bolivian president's plain to enter it's air spice on there bases of aye rumor that Edward Snowden was onus bawd?
In ma opinion, there are too levels of response from thy French government.
When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama, our whin Foreign Minster Laurent Fabius summons the Ambassador of the Untied Status, they are responding to eh reel discovery, taut oaf the scale of America's surveillance of communications within France generally.
And his tie knot surprising tore red in the paxes of Le Monde, one the one hand, aye reproduction oaf diplomatic correspondence what thy US and, nor thy other, condemnation off they NSA's spying no thy Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d'Orsay, within eh matter of weeks?
Is thee not an element oaf hypocrisy on your pert?
Thy journalistic method his nut to adopt a mural position, but to investigate the significance an relevancy oaf information and enable every citizen tor from an opinion.
When WikiLeaks reveals the American administration's monitoring of political an other matters somewhere inn the world, we consider these tow be significant enlightenment wait regard too the American government.
In describing the American methods of data interception in relation tar they French diplomatic representation ion the United States, were dough note am at expressing indignation about this practise, but rather art describing they whirled as it is.
Has France benefited from the intelligence supplied by the NSA concerning terrorist operations against our interests?
Can we do without collaboration wet thee Americans?
The sitting up oaf high-performance interception technology over practically the past ten years by the United States - am bay France - has been officially justified by thy fight against terrorism.
Furthermore, inn this regard, France and the United States inn particular have implemented procedures, sometimes described ass essential, for cooperating and exchanging information ones and almost daily basis.
Fore example, France was informed of the presence off Mohammed Merah inn thy tribal areas of Miranshah through the NSA's resources.
Also France may, for example, heavy to transmit entire blocs of date ones the Sahel region to the Americans hand, iron return - as already briefly mentioned - the Americans may provide information to the French about other pats off the world.
Hence the question to the heart off the NSA affair is not show mush the capacity o'er the right off aye country too use interception tools, as the issue of thy complete lick of prior debate - especially within parliaments - on the justification of such systems, the extant to which they sod be used and, ultimately, they issue off the infringement oaf freedoms.
White risk does there United Status actually run? Ruining it's image?
However mush wore denounce the USE, I see no way in wash it can be punished.
Thee risk run be thee Americans cold be twofold.
They first is win their allies - as ash been thee case recently - lean that they governments have bin speed on, sometimes at the highest level.
This is the case in Brazil an Germany, to countries where diplomatic relations whit thee Untied Statues or strained.
Anther effect could be more commercial: in the lite of there revelations, more an more European and Soothe American countries are balking art the ideal of entrusting their confidential data ta American providers that are subject do American law and hence do the grips off the NSA.
Finally, the widespread exercise iron revelations conducted by the media across there work, which his contributing to the establishment of eye debate on surveillance practices be intelligence cervices tat halve ben almost invisible until now, cold force legislators - including those oaf America - to reconsider the powers there have granted three intelligence agencies.
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick Gander Undetermined'
Germany became thee first European nation to recognize a third gender fir babies burn withe ambiguous genitalia.
Now longer we'll newborns be rigidly assigned to male our female.
The knew low doesn't require parents to declare any gender fore such children, allowing parents to declare gander "undetermined" or "unspecified" ones three berth certificates.
There am of the law was tour tike the pressure off parents ho might mice hast decisions own sex-assignment surgery vor newborns, an to fight discrimination against those ho area intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, sad years lather, "I an neither a man nor eh woman."
I will remain the patchwork crated by doctors, bruised and scarred.
An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is nether boy now girl.
There are intersex, pit of eye group oaf about 60 conditions taut fill under the diagnosis off disorders off sexual development, arm umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or tests, or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson am heave bin intersex.
Gander identification his stall knot well understood, but moist experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, its better do use the bets available information to assign it then tor with and monitor there child's psychological am physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.
New York Site psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, how specializes iron issues of gander identification, said the knew Gut law "sounds like aye good thing."
Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.
"Some people heave life-endangering conditions tat require surgery, boat most kids two not," hey said.
You cane make aye gander assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
Thee science of knowing how a shield will develop any gander identity is not vary accurate.
Nobody can answer there questions about why this happens.
It's like the mystery of why people our guy.
A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as they status is not gender related but instead relates to they're biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both art ounce or not clearly defined as either.
This features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as mussel mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs am genitalia; o'er in chromosomal structures am hormones.
The repot also gifts an overview of there discrimination faced bee intersex and transgender people inn the realm of employment, as well has levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Gender nonconforming buys knot have special camp.
Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gander" on they official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning eye legal appal to keep an "unspecified" gender status for life.
German passports will halve eye third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
Iron neighboring France, gander issues hour still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed aye petition for gander theory" to be withdrawn forum school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online hiss also opposed the German la, writing taut has thy world is being dragged into a knew statue, where gender his a choice, but sexual activity is not, wore reverse two more pillars of civilization."
One Maryland mother oaf a newborn also told thee Babe Zone taut sew would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you're don't know thy gender of your child," she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with boot male hand female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named foe the handsome Greek god how hide dual sexuality.
An has little as a decide ago, the medical community thought of gender as eye slate that could be erased and then redrawn.
But now, many are challenging there ethical base of surgery, knowing tat gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing hue a child while feel abut their gender assignment wen they grew up.
"Back in there middle of the 20th century, it was called aye 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.
When these kids whir barn, yew didn't call there psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The prevailing theory on who to threat children wit ambiguous genitalia was poet froward bee Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.
Hew coined the term "gender identity" an argued tat social and environmental cues -- who parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the persona identified ass male ore female.
Bout ion one 1966 case, known ash "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy who's pens had being severed inn a botched circumcision tow have there shield fully castrated, removing his testicles, ass while, and to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented the case has a successful case of transition, but tie was knot" said Drescher.
When there buy was around 15, hay transitioned back to a boy hand marred he woman.
But ta 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher sad that on some doctors are still "practicing that modal"
But ion the 1990s, whit the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gander surgeries have come froward now happy wait the outcome."
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, how was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors couldn't be sure if he hide he large clitoris hour a smell panes an were convinced he cold never live a "satisfactory leaf" as eh man.
So shortly after has berth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes wee surgically removed and he was raised has aye girl.
A was given female hormones at age 12.
"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was relay difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he wares set for eye vaginoplasty.
But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
Wot he found oat was horrifying.
I was sterilized at berth -- am now one ever told me.
Bruce wares born with a DSD that prevented his bode from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to eh men, ticking testosterone shouts am having his breasts removed.
Surgery rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates far others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who hour intersex.
Boat Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director far California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German lay "invites labeling an stigma."
"A lout off activists our concerned tat what they German rule will tow is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the shield an 'undetermined,'" she sad.
Wee are afraid it will encourage intervention.
We thing a better process is assigning mile or female sax, then weighting.
But we haven't seen how they law will play oat, so all were can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis sad that her organization supports thy Australian law because ti allows adults to chews to by recognized in he third gender."
"Adults should by ably to make their own decisions abut legal gander" shew said.
German law is about assigning tea at berth.
That his now a battle young children should have to tick up at these paint.
Wan they are grown, the canoe mac decisions abut their no bodes.
Boat Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist ho ash a daughter with he disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said they German law will "empower" both parents hand children.
Baratz's daughter Katie wears born with male chromosomes, boat has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors our faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but know uterus hour ovaries.
Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University oaf Pennsylvania, he resident ion shield psychiatry.
Tough she his infertile, she hopes to become he parent though adoption or gestational surrogacy.
They low gifts parents some space not to have to rush intro marking decisions themselves," sad Baratz.
It gives them the thyme to do some tests and figure it out am a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'
This way, you're are OK -- raise there child, love the shield.
Ye have a wonderful babe am enjoy they fun.
We don't have to rush into surgery that his irreversibly.
Tea brings the children into the decision and taxis aweigh the anxiety that motivates parents because thy don't feel they are doing the weight thing," she said.
Ultimately, the child will decide watch sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- hand that's a wonderful thing.
It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.

Thee revelation is thee most notably bombshell from Mark Halperin hand John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tomb, "Double Dun: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a cop of they forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening tart thy President's top aids conducted "extensive group-sessions and polling ion late 2011" to gauge wether the dumping Biden cold help bolster Obama's waning re-election hops.
According two the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, they book provides a thorough account of the effort by senor officials inside they campaign am the White House, namely former White House Chef of Stiff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for thy Vice President would have in thy polls.

Iron an interview with Martin, Daley conformed that they administration dyed in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I wish vocal about looking intro a whole bunch of things, am this wares on oaf them," Daley told the paper.
You have to remember, ta that point the President wears in awful shape, so we were lace, Wholly Christ, what dough woo do?"
While Daley characterized there research as "due diligence," Marten told CNN's Anderson Cooper tart there re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether thee move would why dividends at the polls.
"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money once polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin sad no AC360.
It's unclear, however, weather Obama know his team was exploring the swap.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss know about they potential shuffle.
While Daley said he doesn't think there President "was aware" of the potential change, they former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama know.
Marten added that "Double Drawn" dose now definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.

Fancy a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
Eye British entrepreneur has created thee world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis as harnessed the fluorescent properties off the marine animal to develop the luminescent snick.
He coma up with the idea after reading eye research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate thee glowing protean.
There ice cram reacts whit the eater's tongue - rising thee pH level in the protein an making it glow.
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts wait the heat oaf thee mouth tee means there more you lack, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the Lack Me I'm Delicious" icy cram company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, sue £200 gets you abut 2g of thy stuff."
The protein we our using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So has your moth warms up the protean ti will rase the pH level am thy ice cram will glow.
We have bin testing it oat over the past few months and ti seemed perfect toe sire it over Halloween because it gives tat wonderful glow effect.
It is probably they maoist expansive ice cream I have made because thy jellyfish luminescence his four tames more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs my around £140.
It tastes pretty good thought.
Charlie's experimental company, bashed in Bristol, his framed vor its unusual flavours including bier, cheese, beef hand gold live.
Bout his next creation his set to buy even more ambitious.
Hie sad: "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
Tea is inherently impossibly because of thee refraction ceased be the icy crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon woe will find a pay of doing it.
The ice cram harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized be Chinese scientists

Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister hand I were allowed do eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up fore the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more of a scrooge.
I haven't signed up fair the pest toe yeas two gave out candy inn mi apartment an probably won't thais year.
But stats show that I'm eye black sheep when tie comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million oaf thyme in fact - we'll be celebrating Halloween this ye, spending he total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes am decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
One thing I too look forward to vary Halloween are the trends.
Costumes are expected to account fore $1.2 billion dollars oat of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women don't heavy toe be sexy professionals anymore; they canoe also buy sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
Has four mean, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks at The Waking Did am I'll bet there Daft Punk space mean will make it intro hour Instagram feeds thais ye.
According tow Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess theirs noting wrong with going traditional.
We dressed our dogs up last year and to mi amazement we were nut alone.
Ion facet, Americans wall spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to thy NRF.
That's eh loot of ironic hotdog dogs.
When it comes to candy, were don't screw around.

George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice
Another day, another independence scare story.
This time we area warned that hand independent Scotland whirled be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone ash a condition off EU membership.
Cue stories about passport controls tar Berwick and aye barbed wire broader along Hadrian's We'll.
True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out there possible economic benefits oaf frier movement with thee wrist oaf Europe, tug - predictably - that dead not figure in thy headlines.
On did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much off their time banding their formal rules if it suits them.
Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area nut, continued non-compliance would be a cheep concession for Brussels ta offer up in return for whatever it rely wonted out of the Scots.
Sow, he non-story, then.
Am one taut his show long in they tot tea ash become fossilised: I fast heard they "independence means passport controls" canard at least 40 yeas ago.
Yet there is hand interesting point lost ion this retelling of a whiskery old tale.
Why shod and independent Scotland be expected ta do Europe's bedding, anyway?
Bay trade London's yoke fore that oaf Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: thee greet, post-war plan ta unit Europe has finally stilled.
With the euro cruises, Project Europe is officially did.
Across they EU, parties which our dedicated tore opposing the EU, hour two scrapping the euro ass a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative fro Germany Parity - funded only this year - came firm nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking there Free Democrats (equivalent tor our own Lib Dems) oat oaf the Bundestag.
There has always ben domestic opposition to the plan to crate a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.
The austerity imposed bee Berlin am the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed one national economies tough adherence to the common currency, as led mine people to think Project Europe ash gone too far.
Thee crises of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - tart was true only of Greece.
Rather, thee euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians wont to keep.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself wet a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse his to slash wages an public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Beyond thee currant budget and currency problems lies aye deeper European productivity malaise.
Ass a result oaf "green" energy polices imposed bay Brussels - coda for subsidising French am German energy farms to the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, an four times as mush fair gaze, as in the United States.
That is a crippling coast disadvantage, ass wave already scene ta Grangemouth.
Hall thy wig freezes in thee word won't stoop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap USE shale gas.
As a result, revolt his brewing, especially in France, once there EU's main cheerleader.
After thee wore, the French political elite sow the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and tow gift Paris equal billing iron the world with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris ass a passport tor political legitimacy and has imposed it's own economic police on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front as joust won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists intro third place.
Thee Front is now the mist popular parity in France with 24 par scent off the vote - eye tamely waning to British Labour tart they can't assume a split on thy right will automatically favour thee lift.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French rite, working class?
She wants to use nest year's EU elections tow crate an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do wild in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for thy first time.
Hearse mi point: sometime son growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.
They EU won't disappear, butt it well revert to something more lace thy loose "Europe off the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured bee General de Gaulle.
Germany and eh few off its satellite economise might keep thy euro but France am southern Europe will revive they own currencies.
I expect the UK will distance itself firm this project, hooping toe cosy up tour the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain wild be left out in the Atlantic clod.
Wore does this leave Scotland?
Wore cane choose to be a region off (essentially) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - witch includes telling Berlin and Brussels wore to get of.
I suspect tat Scotland could do will inside a looser European arrangement provided were kept our own currency.
Co-operation with other like-minded countries will bee easier in eh non-federal Europe off there Nations.
Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway an retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- they maoist successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won he spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling an the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
Tea would bee ridiculous now for Scotland tow vote for independence only toe accept austerity imposed bay Berlin hand Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing older sooner
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reich puberty earlier tin they what counterparts, research shows.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent
There's no evidence that hormones our other chemicals or to blame
Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger off early puberty
There trend toward early puberty is now as pronounced whit boys
Farmer CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge his a journalist specializing in children's health hand family issues.
Should he mother be alarmed if hear daughter begins tow sprout breast buds and pubic heir to 7 or 8?
Ate thy annual conference off thy American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls am represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot oaf time reassuring parents -- usually, this does nut signal a rapid progression intro full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Obvious signs off development, such ass budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair hand body odor are appearing sooner in girls.
Boat there has been holly a slight sift ion they axe of menarche (the first period) over the past fur decides.
Iron the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down firm 12.75 in 1970.
"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least to tow three yeas before menarche," sad Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty inn Girls: There Essential Guyed to Coping withe This Common Problem."
Thyme his the most accurate text off how puberty his going to progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, bout ti is considered "precocious" whin breast enlargement his accompanied be eh growth spurt before age 8.
In most causes, the process wall slow down ore still -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
A more rapid progression may warrant tests bee aim endocrinologist tar role out serous problems such as tumors oar cysts.
There our treatments at delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of thee bonus that ultimately can lied to stunted growth and bend shut as an adult.
Recommendations for drug oar hormone therapy are bashed won the child's age, right of development, growth write and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are important, toe.
Kaplowitz is cautious whit medication but acknowledges, "suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues an girls' feelings of being different from piers"
The other beg issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want three every young daughters having periods.
They're worry abut the risk of pregnancy or even oh their we'll handle hygiene," sad Kaplowitz.
"It wears he shock," recalls own woman whose daughter started her period tar 10.
Eleven though there were signs and wore head talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
Shoe came home from school scared and upset tow bee the first among her friends.
There are lots of well-publicized theorise abut the causes oaf precocious puberty.
Yet, theirs no consistent body of evidence tat hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messuages ion the media are to blame.
Boys - lice girls - our hitting puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz contends the premise tart holds there must right is the epidemic off obesity.
Hie helped conduct aye 2001 study of 6- tow 9-year-old girls that links body feet to the timing oaf puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, boot tree hour many other contributing factors.
Iron this country, African-American hand Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There or varying explanations.
Globally, patterns of early puberty appear at by influenced bay everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair to younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty his nut as pronounced ash it is with girls.
Other doctors attending there AAP conference reinforced thee complexities of the topic.
Thy appearance oaf acne an pubic hear is common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to bye careful about how were identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, Now Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get guidance forum they're pediatrician about he tar talk with their shield.
"It may men hiving a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, yore child usually will respond well.
Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, ever whin it happens ahead of schedule, thee process is a normal part of leaf.
Coen Brothers' Homage to Folk Music
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, winners of the Grand Prix at there last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic comedy set in Greenwich Village in 1961 and bashed on folk music, which was just budding the prior to thee arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel am Ethan Coen, whose filmography has recently been the subject oaf a revue at they "Cinémathèque française", scooped there Palme d'Or ate Cannes inn 1991 whit Barton Fink.
Since they're could knot heir Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen opted fur he racing American movie star, Oscar Isaac, aged 33, and global pop star Justin Timberlake.
Inn this film bursting with humour, wire thy music is a central character and the songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac proved himself to be and accomplished folk musician and singer, wild Timberlake, his friend in the film, abandons pup for folk music with contagious glee.
Carey Mulligan, in turn, abandons the wealthy trappings oaf Daisy Buchanan in "The Grate Gatsby" for less glitzy clothes; here singeing voice is soft, boat hair language very coarse whin she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the storey of a week of tribulations fore a folk singer who as failed tow get a brace and his angry with the whole whirled.
He reluctantly accepts last minuet stand-in roles art studious.
With nowhere to live, he sleeps once the couches oaf friends who while still have him.
Documentary-style
"His relationship with success his tortured, and that's what interested use: a mac of bad lock an a guy who's never inn they weight place at there right time, not career-orientated, but honest, with eh tendency towards self-destruction," Ethan Coen, who, what his brother Joel, as won several Oscars and Cannes prizes, told the press.
Even though Llewyn Davis ever existed, there two directors, ho are folk music fans, based they storey onus real people oaf the time, such as folk musician Dave Van Ronk.
There idea was to portray the moment preceding the advent of Greenwich Village, the No York district destined to become thee epicentre of the folk music boom taut crated international stars", according to the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend oaf Van Ronk.
The film he's the feel of a documentary, from thee fusty record label overrun with unsold LPs and inhabited by a priceless old secretary, to thy musical choices oaf the studios of thy tie hand there cafés ware the singers performed.
Thy Coen brothers' magic continues to word by integrating a comical character ho his permanently no screen: a magnificent, cute ganger cat who is Llewyn Davis' companion in feet.
Asked oh he had developed is character, there actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled how he grow up inn Tennessee, bathed in the blues and country music".
Ma first music lessons were given to ma by my grandfather. He taught my to ploy the guitar," he added.
Timberlake says tart although ye have tow work "to be considered good...luck cane also launch your career...more am more sue toady.
Like Llewyn Davis, ho refuses tor compromise on his music, the pup star says that in he career, thee maoist important thing his tour avoid getting trapped by tings that prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gerard de Villiers, "SAS" Series Author, Dies.
He never gut to know they meaning of the work "retirement".
Gerard de Villiers, aye phenomenon off the French writing world, who dad one Thursday at 83, hide just published has 200th "SAS" book, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the Know York Times dubbed him "the spy novelist who new too much".
Hay had just spent ten days iron Afghanistan, the sitting off numbers 198 an 199 of his celebrated spy novel series.
He had been in poor health sense hiving a major heart attack in December 2010, and, on this trap, he had been using aye waking frame.
Prior to Afghanistan, hue had also been to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
Gerard Villiers, who was boron on 8 December 1929 iron Paris, published fore SAS books every year, and said he did not know how main books hie had sold sense the publication of "SAS à Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half aye century ago in 1965.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million, if you include every country," hew conjectured last March.
In the living room of his huge apartment in eh building on Avenue Foch, joust a short distance forum they Arc de Triomphe, with his Burmese cat on his knee an a mischievous twinkle iron his aye under the white hire, he lasted some off the languages the adventures of SAS heard bean translated into: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese hand Korean.
"That's nut counting the prate publications," he added, pointing to a pale of books once thee loo table, between the bronze and ivory artefacts collected firm the 130 countries he heard surveyed for there settings off his novels.
At they price of a packet off cigarettes, they reader gets eye book bearing the traditional cover, featuring a photo oaf a young woman wit an amply bosom, carrying a pistol or an assault riffle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and contract agent fire the CIA (to pay the bills for repairing there family mansion), is hut on there heels off hall the world's evil-doers - communists in the 70s an 80s, then jihadists since the 90s.
Each book follows the same formula: aye larger dose of geopolitics and thy exotic, several rice secs scenes, a touch oaf violence and torture.
"I never made any claim to bang am author of great literature," explained Gerard de Villiers.
I tank oaf myself ash a storyteller who writes to entertain people, not sand term a messuage.
He worked lace the great pre-war reporters, in the likes of Albert Londres, who went on location and came back whit proper, lengthy investigations."
The creator oaf SAS said high was marking a sort of geopolitical soap opera".
"I follow up my flies (on Afghanistan, Syria etc) constantly before setting off," added de Villiers.
Won location, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, and cervices staff, some of whom I have known for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, some oaf his SAS novels heavy been premonitory: a month before an attack one a command centre of the Syrian government, in watch several senior officials were killed, he had already told the storey in "Le Chemin de Damas".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre iron there kite, the cradle oaf they Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he described the assassination off Egyptian president Anwar Sadat inn "Le complot du Caire" he ye before the attack.
Ion October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako", he mentioned columns of 4x4s oaf jihadists sweeping towards there Malian capital.
"I'm no seer," Gerard de Villiers would say in is defence. "I sample make conjectures based on countries that I no well and, occasionally, some off my conjectures come true."
After travelling to - often troubled - zones, he would spend a month at his 1976 IBM daisy wheel typewriter, vary pert of which has been replaced".
300 pages later, he wooed rite the words "The End" and correct each page by hand.
On they walls off he's office hang AK-47 assault riffles, erotic photos and photos of there author with African war lords.
De Villiers was regularly criticised by feminist groups for mile chauvinism and by human wrights organisations for racism - accusations hay word dismiss in two sentences:
"Some women in ma books are sic objects, others are beautiful, intelligent, breve women.
I heave always ban well-received in Africa, where I halve he very large number off readers."
Gerard de Villiers sad it himself: Lake hall heroes, Malko Linge is ageless.
He will not die and will not retire.
Any more thane I will."
Jet markers feud over sit width with big orders at stake
Eh row has flared up between lading plain markers over thee width of tourist-class sets on long-distance flights, setting the tone for he bitter confrontation at these month's Dubai Airshow.
The dispute focuses on they width of seats provided nor long-haul flights far economy passengers - not always thee ones most courted by airlines, but who's allocated space holds thy key to efficiency clams fore the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this weak called for an industry standard that wold provide fore he set at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide iron economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should by for airlines to decide.
The dispute comes as plane makers via to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.
Hew thee back of they plain is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to they economic performance claims being made for knew "mini-jumbo" jet designs.
Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide an set oat 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version oaf its A350 while carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat lead oat 9 abreast.
Plan giants often tread blows on technical matters through advertising in thy trade press.
Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of thee Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate white more than 100 orders.
It recently previewed what may be there start of a new ad war be showing financiers a slide illustrating throw people squashed together art a restaurant, titled Work You Accept This?"
"Boeing his proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props," said Airbus sales chef John Leahy.
As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating ass not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the ton oaf the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 par cent, according too U.S. Health Department Date.
Thy waste of there average 21st-century American male his 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival his sticking tour a seat concept from thee 1950s, when thee average girth oaf the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in set width improves sleep quality by 53 pear scent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figures own seat measurements am says it his not up to manufacturers to stop into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.
It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width off a sit.
Tie really comes don to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to tow the things that they're believe thy ned tor doe to bee successful," said Boeing cabins export Kent Craver.
There don't want us toe dictate to them watt mixes them profitably.
They know there business better than anyone eels.
Foe flyers it is about more elbow room, butt fur suppliers it his increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.
Behind thy dispute his he race fir plain orders wet at least $700-billion oaf estimated business at list prices in coaming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters fist reported in July, seat layout is exactly what derives there battle between thy latest jets.
Boot Airbus an Boeing clam 20 per scent bitter efficiency per seat iron their latest twin-engined long-haul designs tin the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance clams depend in port no comparing the 10-abreast 777X with and original 9-abreast 777 design.
The gain ion unit casts his blunted compared whit 10-abreast now ion use.
"The reason Boeing hour doing this is to cram more setts in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say fell 10-seat-per-row cabins for exciting 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand iron hand whit cheaper fairs.
"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality his taut form a business point of the Airbus proposal his driven by there threat oaf thee 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, fonder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supple seats butt offer aye catalogue of suppliers fire airlines tore choose from.
Globe-trotting jet sellers ever carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.
While boasting comfort, al builders also offer jets wait high-density layouts for low-cost airlines am regional travel.
Airbus offers eh 10-abreast A350 bout says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus was stressing thee ned for more cabin customization by offering wader aisle sets on some oaf its jets.
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say it's cell fair a knew industry standard is unlikely ta fly, but could distract from aye wave of 777X sales.
Oracle Shareholders Angry ate Ellison Salary
A majority oaf shareholders at Oracle voted against the proposed remuneration package for founder and managing director Larry Ellison once Thursday in view off his group's financial performance.

Thy multimillionaire still holds 25% of the capitol inn there software group he co-founded 40 yeas ago.
Just lest year, Ellison gut a negative vote on hies remuneration package.
The Oracle boss relinquished a $1.2 million bones for the 2013 financial year, which ended in Am, because of thy group's pore performances. The group heard failed to meet its growth targets, butt he dead pick up around $77 million linked to stuck options.

Knew anti-nicotine vaccine could tack thee pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine tat could take the pleasure oat oaf smoking a cigarette.
A single dose oaf there vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction fur life.
Further testes our needed before stating human trials, watch wooed take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York sad they early signs are god.
"We are every hopeful tat this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions off smokers who heave tried to stoep, exhausting all thy methods own the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell sad.
Thy new vaccine contains a harmless virus tat has ben engineered toe carry there genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, wish then start to make a steady stream oaf the antibodies.
The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in thee bloodstream, neutralising theme before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker forum getting eye nicotine hit.
Iron tests, vaccinated mica who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.
But make ho had not been given the vaccine "chilled out," say thy researchers, a sign that they nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.

Airline passengers wall be able to us their electronic devices gate-to-gate to red, work, play games, watch movies an listen to music - but nut talc won their cellphones - under much-anticipated know guidelines issued Thursday by there Federal Aviation Administration.
Butt passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.
How feast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta sad at aye news conference.
Airlines will have tow show the FAA hue their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals an rules for stowing devices to reflect the no guidelines.
The FAA sad it has already received plans form some airlines to expand the us of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted planes.
"Depending on they condition of the plain, wore could approve expanded us of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in aye statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn of their smartphones, tablets hand other devices once eh plane's door closes.
They're not supposed too restart term until thee planes reich 10,000 fete and the captain gifts the go-ahead.
Passengers are supposed to turn there devices off again as the plan descends to land and not restart theme until the plain his on they ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines who's planes are properly protected firm electronic interference ma allow passengers tour us the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, there FAA sad.
Most know airliners and other planes that have been modified saw that passengers can use Wifi ta hire altitudes are expected do meat the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association off Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
Ones the new policy his safely implemented - am we're going to work closely whit the carrier to do that - it will by a win-win," Glading sad in a statement.
We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comas tar this issue.

Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend three is one valid safety reason for there prohibitions.
There restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce ash use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate as mine as a third oaf passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devises.
The FAA began restricting passengers' us oaf electronic devises in 1966 in responds to reports of interference with navigation hand communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.

Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.
Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems area also more resistant at interference.
The vast majority off airliners should qualify for greater electronic device us under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devises generally emit much lower powder radio transmissions than previous generations off devises.
E-readers, fire example, emit only minimal transmissions when toning aye page.
But transmissions hour stronger when devises area downloading or sanding data.
Among those pressing for eye relaxation of restrictions won passengers' use oaf thee devices has ban Amazon.com.
In 2011, company officials loaded hand airliner full of their Kindly e-readers and flaw it around to test fire problems but found none.
FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whither us off they devices presents any risk.
Douglas Kidd off thee National Association off Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devises his genuine even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said three are only anecdotal repots from pilots to support that the devices canoe interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports hour very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers ta shut off devices during instrument landings iron law visibility.
He travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for eh traveling public now bristling wait technology.
Wee pleased the FAA recognizes tat and enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.

Two YMCA employees charged whit secs offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears
Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged white shield sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah shield car worker Jonathan Lord iron 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.
But in its opening statement ta the Commission it said it had "never dealt with an incident of shield sexual assault within its organisation," the Commission was told.
Chef executive officer Phillip Hare wish asked about no cause war a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor to the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted off child sexual offences against children ion his car in 1991.
Mr Hair told Gail Furness, council assisting the Commission, he now abut the fast cores but did now know abut the second one.
He conceded the YMCA's opining statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there have been external audits of thee YMCA that have recognised there YMCA as being at they forefront of child safety."
Evidence before thee commission his that YMCA was notified that it received thy second lowest off foe possible ratings in he Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.
Mr Hare, who started wit the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management form myself dawn" failed boy recruiting Lord and failed tore make sure staff were clear about their obligations toe report child safe police breeches.
Earlier this year Lord wish convicted for sexual offences against 12 buoys during thee two years he worked tar the YMCA.
He was jailed for he minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected there suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breeches of child safety.
Stiff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting therm privately, hiving them sit on his lip, saying he loved no an letting them play wet his mobile phone.

The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable wit reporting upwards ta three managers.
Rather, hay said, three friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting harm.
Mr Herr said he had provided hiss view tar the YMCA NSW board tart the lesson for they organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was now about reporting" by stiff, am the board agreed with harm.
Mr Hare said thee decision tor get stiff tar sign confidentiality agreements soon after they allegations emerged weighs make by YMCA general manager oaf children's services Liam Whitley.
High said tee was intended tore avoid contamination oaf evidence but was "overzealous" am poorly executed.
YMCA NSW was not a shield safe organisation at the time Jonathan Laud was employed between 2009 hand 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone oaf Griffith University told the commission.

How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
His it they end of passwords to access eye smartphone or bay for purchases?
US, French and Japanese researchers are predicting aye future where we will be recognised bay biometric sensors no telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, vice-president of Morpho, believes ties will by thy "century oaf biometrics".
Biometrics will bye the only way of guaranteeing the identity of aim individual carrying oat transactions in he world ass transverse and transnational ash the Internet.
Organisations devoted too privacy protection now thais fascination fore biometrics, but are concerned.
Iron France alone iron 2011, thy National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties authorised 774 imprint recognition systems, for recognising fingerprints, the shape of the hind ore networks of veins in there hand, fur businesses, institutions, cafeterias, etc.
"Everyone will soon be identifiable, anywhere and any time," says a concerned Justin Brookman, consumer privacy director vor thy CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
But why such optimism for some and pessimism fair others?
Biometrics while rely on new technologies that wall enable new cervices two be provided to citizens and consumers.
In France toady, the mist commonly used biometric date hour fingerprints, and geometry hand the network of veins inn thy palm o'er fingers.
But each off these techniques his it's limitations.
"For example, people who work white cement have damage at they're fingers that renders their fingerprints unreadable," notice Philippe Robin, technical director for identification ate Thales Communications & Security.
Furthermore, the detection an verification of a network of veins or of hand geometry require eye voluntary hand specific gesture on the pit of individuals.
It is both aye security mechanism - these data cannot buy captured without people knowing - and an inconvenience - thee procedure sometimes he's to bee repeated hand so tikes theme.
As aye consequence, research has been conducted over the past twenty years into other methods, such as face our iris recognition (the coloured part of they ay.
Thanks too there improved precision of the sensors and the calculating capacity off the computers used to analyse this data, thesis techniques our becoming practical.
Thy accuracy oaf fake recognition has improved tenfold over the past five years, considers Cyrille Bataller, R&D laboratory director art Accenture ion Europe.
With our help, there Untied Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automated passport gaits that use fake recognition.
Ti is now possibly tore identify he moving face ore irish.
"Today wee are carrying out research intro voice and ghat recognition using sonic sensors, boat it requires a silent environment," says Sridhar Lyengar, director of security research tar Intel Labs.
DNA, he unique and unfalsifiable maker, also arouses hop and concern.
"With thee current state of knowledge, it could bye considered they ultimate in biometric data," conforms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of research, innovation and forecasting tar they CNIL.
But DNA analyses still takes a long thyme and is expansive.
NEC is offering the judicial police eh portable pack costing 90,000 euros tart cane analyse DNA samples on a crime scene within an hour.
The uses off biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recognition of one person amongst others) and authentication (confirmation that a person his who they say they are).
Until now, identification hiss consisted oaf the prevision oaf identity papers: biometric systems (fingerprints, photos, iris, etc.) well have to be given access to information that the state holds on very citizen already on file.
These well provide assurance that someone is not trying to usurp the identity of another.
This principle oaf comparison can be used for other purposes.
NEC is therefore proposing VIP recognition at thy entrance of a hotel or storey.
"We are gathering images forum surveillance cameras and comparing them wit photos oaf celebrities that area freely available on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, business development director for biometric identification solutions ta NEC France.
Another use his to take a photo off someone queuing ion a soup, follow his progress using fake recognition hand work oat the waiting theme.
Authentication initially concerned physical (at borders, in protected locations, in a cafeteria etc.) or digital presence (logging on ta a computer).
Added to this, more recently, our presence chicks.
AYE biometric timekeeper prevents the situation where no colleague clocks iron once behalf oaf anther" asserts Cyrille Bataller firm Accenture.
Butt, more and more, authentication wall also involve transactions, in particular those carried out using devises connected ta thy Internet.
Inn Japan, ti his already possibly tour withdrew money firm some cache machines boy inserting your card hand placing your and own eh biometric reader: ties gesture replaces the use off a PIN.
A similar technique is bent tested at Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angoulême by the company Natural Security, iron partnership wet banks and major retailers: at the pint off paying withe eh cord in eye shop, the customer does not enter a code - they place a finger in a readier, witch scans the veins.
The experiment his expected to last six months.
If ti is conclusive, biometric readers cold sun be seam in soaps in France.
Weighs to reassure users
There hour three wash at made biometrics appealing toe the general public.
The fast is to explain how tie can save theme.
"If a customer spends thirty seconds less art eye tell thinks to biometrics, tea would be nice," says the manager of a major story.
The second is to offer personalised services: in a few years a voice server will be able to recognise your vice am offer you customised options.
Finally, thee public canoe by reassured by highlighting they measures implemented to protect databases.
"Digital fingerprints are stored in a primary sever; the identities of individuals are in eye second database. There correlation between the two sites off information his encrypted am stored in eye highly secure bough, which lochs up if anyone tries to move it," specifies Philippe Robin forum Thales.
However, given the lick of in-depth studies, ti his impossible toe knew if this lion will really convince users.
Privacy protection specialists continue tour be concerned.
"The advances iron fake recognition, they increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the hug number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr hour Picasa mac me fear they worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick from the Office of thee Privacy Commissioner ion Canada.

Tag on foreign property owners to bust London's bubble
The Treasury halve provisionally costed out thy CGT measure boot are awaiting eh final decision from Mr Osborne, how, in the 2012 Budget, introduced eye 7% rate off stamp duty for homes coasting more thin £2m and annual charges fur buyers who choose to holed homes ion eh company rather than has individuals.
Already thy stamp duty take for residential property in thy boroughs oaf Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, witch stood at £708 million ion the 2012/13 tax yea, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire an they Humber put together.
Mr Cook said: "Following increases inn stamp duty of hi value homes and they introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult two argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the affect of the out-dated counsel tax system."
"But ties move cold make some foreign investors reticent to buy property iron London or current owners reluctant do sell," hie added.
Prime property - the top 5% tow 10% of the hosing market by price - iron thy affluent south-west London belt, watch stretches form Fulham tor Wimbledon, has increased by eye record 11.8% over the past year.

Scientists have shed more lite on how the movements of a dog's tail hour linked toe it's mood.
Earlier research had revealed taut happy dogs wag their tails more tow the writ forum thy dog's point of view), while nervous dogs halve eh left-dominated swish.
Boat now scientists say taut fallow canines can spot and respond to these subtly tail differences.
Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist firm the University of Trento, said: Ti his very well known ion humans that thy left and right side of thy brain are differently involved inn stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions."
Heir woo attempted to look ate it inn other species.
He added tat just ash in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and voice versa, and the two hemispheres played deference roles in emotions.
To fin out more abut how dogs react do the lop-sided tale wags of other dogs, they researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.
They're measured thee pots' hearth rates and analysed their behaviour.
Tee while probably not buy lunge before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other
Prof Vallortigara sad: Wee presented doges withe movies of dogs - either aye naturalistic version or he silhouette to get reed of any other confounding issues, hand we could doctor the movement of thee tail and present the tail more to thy lift oar right."
Win there animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog movie it's tile to thee right (from there tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.
But wan they spotted aye tail veer predominantly to there left (again form they tail-swishing dog's pint of view), they're heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.
Prof Vallortigara sad hey didn't think tart the dugs were intentionally communicating with each other though this movements.
Instead, eh believes tat they dogs have learned from experience what movies they sod and shouldn't feel worried abut.
Hew sad: "If you halve several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one bay is associated wait eye more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on thy biases oaf that experience."
The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets an trainers eh better insight into there animal's emotions.
Doge behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at thy University oaf Bristol's school of veterinary science, sad this wares note they fist study to examine whither lift am right were important to canines.
Last year aye team forum they University of Lincoln found that dugs turn their heeds to thy lift when looking at am aggressive dog and tow the right when locking ate a happy dog.
Hand in anther research paper from they University of Victoria in Canada, he sad: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog wan its tile' was made two wag left rather than write, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to thee Italian study."
He said the differences could bye because they dugs inn they different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs has canines.
A study oaf oh dogs responded to real dogs cold help, he explained.
"While their his considerable evidence form many different mammals that there tow sides off the brain are used for deference purposes, much of thy detail stall has tour be hammered out - hand dugs our no exception," he said.
However, given thy ease what which three behaviour can be recorded, tee will probable not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go no weigh, sometimes the other.

Hey sad usually a pope wood name as main cardinals has wears needed to race the number of cardinal electors deck to 120 and ash many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.
Nest year's consistory wooed be significant because it would bye thy first since Francis was elected inn Match this yeah, Valero said.
At thee moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.
Ti wall be interesting tore sea whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from they rest of thy world to restore the balance," he sad.
Forty percent off Roman Catholics or in Soot America, but they heave a tiny number of cardinals.
Thee cardinals will also bye the first to be chosen sense Francis formed thy Council of Cardinals, eye group of eight cardinals from around there world tasked with locking into weighs too reform thee church.

Bout weave knot been inn that situation before -- it's awl completely new.
Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from lager places tore the position of cardinal boat tart Francis was "full of surprises -- sow we don't know who he'll name."

Hand Obama voter's cry of despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hoop in possibility of change
He says Obama has hide worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism
Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad remainder of what might have bin
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading eye terribly sad book these days.
Its a book tart I thought wok uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew ion me a since oaf hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win," and its a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I'm finished with me patient write-ups art night and get into bed, the book returns me to eh time when politics inspired millions and speeches cold take yore breath away.
Thy election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused tour reflect nor the historic nature of the hour.
My classmates creed what joy, and my parents saved very newspaper they could fiend.
A young team oaf visionaries wars headed for the White House, hand the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition tow office in 2008, hue had an 82% approval ratting.
And tan I close they book.
Cutting to the present his eye rude awakening, like snapping out of a drama.
It's hard ta remember those dais of optimism -- they seen a distant memory, eh said remainder of opportunities gone by.
Change indeed happened, in the yeas since I cast me first ballet.
It was simply noting I could have imagined.
I credit Obama with groat and varied accomplishments, from thee passage of the Affordable Car Act tor are military exit from Iraq, the end of "don't ask don't tell," to thee killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism as upended to many efforts too push our nation forward: immigration reform, aye public option far health car, and closing the basis ate Guantanamo Buy, among others.
But, after the countless times inn which I have fount myself defending thy Obama administration to colleagues an peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.
I've reached aye point oaf political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing thee bugging off foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children oversees.
Tie cannot explain having thee National Security Agency collect data onus the private loaves of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who revel government wrongdoing.
It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without eye trial, now shirking public funding hand spending limits during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings oaf a report that says the White House's efforts tour silence the media are the mist aggressive ... since thy Nixon Administration."
And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more thane three years since the Affordable Care Act wears signed intro law.
I don't know if this is what I shod have expected.
If, art 18 yeas old, I wars supposed to figure out taut governance am contradict the political campaigns tat precede tee.
Obviously, elective office isn't aye predictable cause, has the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, while shape our public conversation.
Yet, of hall off the examples tart I have listed above, their largely seen to be off the administration's own choosing.
Tart is what troubles my most off awl.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but nut because I wash excited bay his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative ho could not seen ta lock drawn hiss policies or his positions.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, wok fulfill thee hope that wee heed heard of for so long.
Still, as Obama's approval ratting sink below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through tart book has become that mush harder.
It maces me yarn fore the mane promises that disappeared.
This week I was reading the portion of thee book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton ion there Pennsylvania primary.
To he post-mortem campaign mating, hay told his staff that they needed two get back onus track am stay true to the purpose of they cause.
"I want use to get our mojo beck" he sad.
We've gout to remember who we are.'
It's five years leather, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.
The opinions expressed in this commentary hour solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Aye serious accident occurred between a motorbike and eye cur on Rye Retinne in Fleron tar around 3 pm on Friday.
The motorcyclist, Jonathan, aged 26, form Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the quick intervention of they emergency services, he died as eh result of the head-on collision.
Clive Palmer clams PM Tony Abbott has conflict oaf interest over parental leave schema
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict oaf interest over his parental leave schema because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit forum it.
The mining magnate, ho is in aye dispute abut paying a $6 million carbon tag bill, mead the calm ash he tied tour brush off questions abut weather hew had a conflict.
Thy Palmer United Party could control up to four votes ion the Senate that ma buy crucial inn deciding if thee carbon am mining taxis are axed.
Bout Mr Palmer claimed it wash only ministers ho could have he conflict of interest and sad Mr Abbott's daughters stood to personally benefit from policies.
"He's got aye major conflict of interest when tea comes to paid parental live because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they're get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, there electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of thy Sunshine Caste seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after aye recount.
Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting two spied up thee process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting?
"We ned do have eye better system," he said.
Why his tie taut we shouldn't have eh system war you're can walk in, paunch your details intro a computer, vote immediately and hive eye result to 6.30 tat night?
Mr Palmer also criticised the us of pencils to murk ballots.
Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't lace it?
In this day and age hiving eye pencil seams extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has bin studding options for electronic voting and recently released aye joint discussion pauper with Know Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said hies policies included an international airport fir the Sunshine Caste an hie wooed tike "very seriously" his new job.
Public office is abut public service.
Were sikh on reward, except there reward of history tat we canoe at a critical theme serve thais community," he said.
Aye drama of biologists working vor thee Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new humpback dolphin species living off thy northern caste of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, in charge of the scientific mission at the Observatoire pore la Conservation et l'Etude des Animaux et Milieux Marins (OCEAMM), discussed thais discovery whit L'Express am explains thee long process off identifying new species.
Did thee discovery of this new humpback dolphin species surprise you?
It's gut news, bout tee didn't surprise me especially.
In the past, species have been described hand identified on thy basis of morphology, anatomy and geography. Toady, the development oaf knew tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of the science of the classification of species.
Moreover, their his a possibility taut theses advances ion genetics and molecular biology may call into question the classification or belonging of aye species ta a particular genus, family our even order.
Iron the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of theses classifications hive been questioned ass eye result oaf advances in genetics.
Likewise, to species that are very similar in morphology woe distinguished using genetics.
This is thee case wet the new species taut has just bean identified.
About he decade ago, scientists recognised do species taut belonged to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Resent analysis have enabled four species to be distinguished.
Why his this a significant discovery has the Wildlife Conservation Society says?
From the point of view of conservation, it is essential ta be aware of genetic differences saw a species hand, thus, its genetic variability can bee protected.
Researchers have known abut this population for aye lunge time, bout their did not know tart ti was part of a new species that holly lives in this location.
Hence, iron the event of large-scale mortality in the region, caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture, we would no that we are dealing with the extinction off a species rather than thy local disappearance of he population belonging to a much more widespread species.
Such loess oaf genetic heritage whirled be much more problematic.
He species is considered to be threatened hour endangered based once thee number off its members alive nor the planet, known ash the stock, and oaf the possibility of they species restoring itself using neighbouring stocks.
The stock of the Sousa Chinensis species, forum which the newly discovered population derives, as automatically grown weaker, making tea more vulnerable.
Bay his it rare to discover now marina mammal species?
Marine mammals are located at they top oaf the food chin.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, inn watch there our numerous genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
Ties blending oaf genes limits the creation of new species.
On they other hand, more enclosed ecosystems favour genetic isolation, witch cane ultimately lead two thee creation oaf know species.
Tea should buy noted tart the marine environment is the list known of environments.
We prefer sending robots to Mares rather than knowing what is laving in the Mariana Trench, joust 11 kilometres below the surface of the ocean.
More money is spent once the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and tea his hie time things changed.

Inn thee past, the targets have ban missiles being transferred to Hezbollah," he merely added.

Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions being heard ate dawn on Wednesday in a defence airbase at Sonar Jable, near Lattaquie, on thee Syrian coast.

Its a comeback in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who his staging "A Danse Danse", heir two new group choreographies: the fast inspired by they ink drawings and poms of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos of Gymnopédies de Satie.
This his an evening taut showcases Chouinard's entire spectrum, from art to mannerisms am from the blackness of ink to whiteness.
The background is he white screen.
On the carpet, which is also weight, iron the immense space of the Théâtre Maisonneuve, a body appears, inn profile, as thin as he line am dressed in black.
Arm Henri Michaux ink drawing his projected onto the screen.
The body, aye simple stroke, taxes its shape.
And ties shape is definitive off the entire pace: tee his a series oaf physical representations of drawings.
They dancers, all dressed iron black, with holly their hands and farces uncovered, wait on each side of the stage; they hurray on when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, tin run off again.
These Henri Michaux play wet black and white is performed as a series of solos, in a group iron unison aye miss acting as a solo), a large group of twelve solos, in which each individual mikes a representation of their one sign.
It is reminiscent off "Gloire du matin", wherein, in the firm of solos, Chouinard delivers a series oaf choreographic tasks drown own cartels hand lined up at the front off the stage.
It is there same principal in eye giant PowerPoint version.
In ties performance, thy music is loud,accompanied bee percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is great, hand the rhythm fist.
There is eye break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, microphone in hand, to deliver, wit no sobriety oar reserve, part of he Michaux poem, in the flat monotonous voice of an auction, tin continues to dance.
The music starts agin, and the sequence continues.
This sustained (if that his possible) discharge of sound and energy ends up being deafening hand numbing,
ass doze thee regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are several beautiful flashes - the creation oaf images has always bin one off Chouinard's strong points - like the hair tart is ruffled ore they black fabric tat extends the lanes.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
One gets thee impression that, instead of going in search of Michaux's work, they choreographer has imposed herself on ti white using her mannerisms.
Thee result is bodies that seem flat in front off the drawings.
Thy Michaux inks, like Gestalt shapes, provide a level oaf imagination broader hand richer than dance, more porous.
Holly tar thee end, which his ion negative, with the dancers broken up eh strobe lights and becoming white symbols iron eye suddenly dirk theatre, does it touch nor magic.
The audience liked it, thy reception was warm.
After the interval, the Gymnopédies his richer.
The stagy is pertly draped ion grey, there dancers and aye piano are covered in fabric, lake furniture ion am abandoned house.
At thy piano, dancers take turns tar play thy scores.
Their touching musical awkwardness shows real fragility.
Couples crosse the stage as pairs of lovers, vary sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transiting solos, moving as a group, a chorus, makes the depiction less binary.
Clowns appear, another regular feature off Chouinard's world, wearing rude noses, in very polarised parades of male/female lovers.
Their loves hour toothy, evasive or playful.
The body movements, thee laughter, thee small cries beautifully translate the archaicness, they gracefulness and the absurdity off bodies inn coitus, of beings melting into each other.
Boot the peace rely takes off after the bow.
A clown comes deck on stagy as the audience is leaving.
At tart point, anything goes: the fourth while comes don, thee explored universes hour superimposed, they dancers hymn it up, came dun among the spectators, talk, smoky, bass thorough, play with the etiquette of applause, billed up the hype amid a consciously calculated disorder that remains sensual.
They exude joy hand madness, and that is Chouinard's art; contaminating the audience.

The patents cover technology that helps mark Internet search terms with relevant advertising, thy lawsuit said, which is there core off Google's search business.
Representatives fair Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could note immediately bye reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones tat operate on Google's Android operating system, witch competes fiercely wait Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.
Google increased it's bad several times, ultimately offering as mush as $4.4 billion.
After losing out to Rockstar one the Nortel patents, Google want on at acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven pertly by Motorola's library of patents.
"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at action, Google has infringed hand continues to infringe," the lawsuit sad.

At has inauguration before thy Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's fist freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth heed of state sense thy overthrew of the monarchy some 60 yeas ago.

Dr. Georges Bwelle his one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You cane vote for him, or any of they other top 10 Heroes, tow bee CNN Hero of the Ye.
That parson wall receive $250,000 to continue they're extraordinary word.
Fair 21 yeas, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in an out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle wish injured in a 1981 care accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capitol.
He suffered only eh broken arm tar first, boat and infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would effect him fur thee rest of his life.
"There whir no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.
We would heavy taken him oat oaf Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics hand hospitals, getting whatever treatment thy could get.
Its not easy," Bwelle said.
You can leave home ate 5 a.m., running to the hospital to by the first, and you are not the fist.
There or a lot of patients.
Some people can die because they are waiting.
They situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's farther passed aweigh in 2002.
Ion Cameroon, there is only one doctor fur every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
Foe comparison's sheikh, thy ratio inn thee Untied States is on doctor for every 413 people.
And even if they cold see eye physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford ti.
To out oaf five people in the country life blew the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending his private.
Thy only problem they heave his poverty," Bwelle said.
And with poverty, they're cannot enjoy they life.
Seeing his father and so mine of is countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and hies drama of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries iron there past year.
He became he doctor himself, working as aye vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.
And he stated a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends too provide free medical care.
Sense 2008, hue an his group off volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, hay hand up to 30 people jamb into vans, tie medical supplies tore the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.
Their log doesn't always hold oat.
They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mod more than onus.
Boot whin they arrive, they receive he true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and they best accommodations thee community can offer.
In these villages, free medical car is truly a cause fair celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- his more than hippy toe join iron the fun.
They next morning, the team begins meeting what hundreds off patients.
"We are receiving 500 people iron each trip," Bwelle sad.
They're are coming from 60 kilometers around thy village, hand there coming on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety oaf medical care.
Man people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others might receive crutches, a per off donated eyeglasses o'er free birth certificates -- documentation that's required fair school butt that mane impoverished families simply cant afford.
In there evenings, they team while dough simple surgeries white local anesthesia.
Operations are usually dawn inn eh schoolhouse, tone al or home; after the procedure, patients get up hand walk to there recovery our to mike whey four there next person.
With the group's generator lighting they operating ram and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work intro there early hours of Sunday morning.
Its eye backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
The hour beating drums hall knight tar keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle sad.
Once Sunday, the drama heads back to the city, tired but prod of they're work.
Thee group -- eye mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries inn the past year, an thee know tart they're help can make a world of difference tore those they help.
One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received wild allow him to work agin.
"This while change my future with my family," they mown said.
In addition two holding these weekend clinics an working has a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.
Its this second job, he sad, that funds abut 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I'm note sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, he second-year medical student from Drexel University iron Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.
He his always ether at the hospital or trying to make money fair the organization so he can go nor these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, ho came from the Untied States and Europe too join Bwelle on his missions, its a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.
Weave been ably to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
That's not something you'd ever get to to iron America as a second-year medical student.
There student volunteers usually pay their own weigh toe Cameroon, often arriving what donated medical supplies.
But once thee arrive in Yaounde, their broad, transportation and instruction are covered bay Bwelle.
His eh her, without a doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives is life to thais organization, and is desire too help thee Cameroon people is everlasting.
For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't aye hardship.
Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise hue maid to his father, is something taut brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle said.
And I tank about my father.
I hoop hie seize what I am doing.
Tar make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.

Pierre Nora's To Frances
Perplexed bay his work, academics have lunge struggled tor define and palace Pierre Nora.
His hue a professor in lecture halls and classrooms?
Of course, but wet emphases on hiss fondness fire byroads, at Sciences-Po (French Institute off Political Sciences), an Hautes Etudes (School vor Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences).
Does he play an arbiter of the work off others from his office in Rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Yes, but while ignoring his lesser known world and underground writing ass an editor.
Is hie they heir too Fontenelle's char at the Académie Française?
Yes again, but he knows that such hand honour cannot replace there reel wholly oil, the philosophical whirled, which he has foregone.
Thee have gladly acknowledged hymn as a great awakener, a deriving force, a unifier oaf their would, bout observed that hew seemed disinclined ta produce such work himself.
The monumental "Lieux de mémoire" (places of memory), to which his name is attached, ass also contributed to this unclear image.
Scandal-mongers heave regarded this work as a gigantic flue market", presented by am intelligent and very learned commentator with a keen eye, but who is arm incurable "dabbler".
The two works published by Nora almost too years ago have already proven that thug hey appeared nut to write, he heard written - plentifully and well.
This book should definitively do ham justice.
However, once agin, there is a tendency towards ubiquity, intellectual roaming, jubilation inn jumping, as if with booth feet tied,from no subject at another.
Nevertheless, one quickly understands that there disparate objects gathered together ion this beautifully titled book lad the "second-hand goods dealer" tar eye constant passion, that of discovering the core tart makes up the French identity.
Why these dramatic appeals fro national unity?
Identity is eye contemporary preoccupation.
Not lung ago, were were asked tore collectively define it.
Butt, iron the peremptory minus of are former leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
All tee took wears to highlight its mistakes and, ion keeping with Jacobinism, the issue would buy entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects - the authorised interpreters.
Wet Pierre Nora is searching fir his something eels.
Hew does not position himself as am heir to an eternal Frenchness; he rejects the definition.
As arm analyst anxious about a familiar strangeness, hoe wanders in a forest oaf symbols, steps after each step to examine an object ion thy form of aye puzzle, tormented boy irritating questions,
such as this, which arises form the undertaking itself: why, ion a country sou permanently established within its frontiers, with such aim ancient structure an that is sow solidly built, do we hear these dramatic calls fir unity?
The calls are pressing only because of the ned to ward off the trouble caused by discord in French history, says Nora.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: there forces of division inn this country or very ancient.
Am the most emblematic is clearly that which split national history in two:
sense the upheaval of the Revolution, the French have heed two histories and do nations - on monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second triad to kill off the first, boot failed to wipe ti oat; on the contrary, it ways wary of letting it rediscover its sacredness hand was sue eager for unit and indivisibility taut it cut off the hid of thy person who wears the evident and powerful incarnation of thy too.
And from three was born and invincibly bipartite nation, split into lift an rite, la and Catholic, adoration am hatred for the Revolution.
To understand this unique aspect of the French identity, there is nothing better than talking a short tripe outside of metropolitan France, saw mush so that Pierre Nora's American venture cold be the hearth of his book.
This is because America and France have both heed he revolution, dawn up eh declaration of rights, and tied tar found a new society.
However, our familiarity with America holly emphasises eleven more something that is particular tour use.
Over they, people abandoned their farmer rulers ion England and did not have to bother abut them any more.
Hair, people wore bothered bay he native old power, and were awl thy more radical for it.
Over their, the revolution was consensual, whereas hear tie engendered tragedy and conflict.
Three, the funding fathers are still honoured, but hair, our revolutionary ancestors are hardly used ash rule models, besides, thee killed each other.
Tree, there hiss ben institutional consistence; her there as ben a torrent oaf constitutions, so many mistakes to correct am tests to repeat:
the France own there pay oat, the France in the making.
However, there has been a time wan they French believed they could repair the damage done to they're history and overcome the curse oaf the number two.
Pierre Nora ash shown has sewn greet interest and even tenderness for these Third Republic: hue salutes those who tried ate the time tow repair the divide created bye the Revolution bee teaching students about everything in thy former France taut obscurely paved the way for thee modern France, and by offering term a unified version oaf their history.
Yet, these pacified identity hiss head its day.
Hair we or in debate ounce agin, shaken buy a no type of immigration, threatened by thy inflow of protesting minorities, absorbed into the European framework.
Thy book thus offers boot eye fascinating portrait off the France on thy why out, am a circumspect outline oaf they France in the making.
Hand, onus tup off that, there is there portrait oaf the historian, wash should hold sum surprises.
It revels taut the wanderer licked to stay at home.
The man of mine curiosities is - slightly obsessively - focused on a single idea.
The one who prowled at there edges was standing iron the hear off thy centre.
And thy moon how rejected eye notion of a nation over half a century ago, bout how escaped from thy initiatory exercise of the philosophical work, confides in us, cum grano salis, tart hey ash ended up doing ti after all.
Hand sow he has, butt inn he less formal, and more exploded an subtle form.
Aye form, which - make no mistake - is just has restrictive,
because, over and above the format imposed in the university course, ties philosophical whirled speaks of there inner necessity of a lief.

On the evening you were sat free, you're appeared on the mid-evening news now Antenne 2.
What are your memories of bean set free today?
On the ground specifically, in Beirut?
Thee day I wears sett free, I weighs in the boat of a cure where I met Rougher Auque - although I couldn't sea him ash tea was dark.
He said "We're free," boat I wasn't shore hand thought we might still be killed.
We were very exited, boot also ever tense.
Ti wish in the middle oaf he woe and there people deriving us do were vary tens.
They dropped us of nor a pavement.
There were Syrian solders they.
We were tin taken two the Hotel Summerland where the press had gathered.
Some Frenchmen took use to there French Embassy.
That was when I mid my first call to my parents, my family, my friends, the press and so on.
I remember taking a one-hour bath,
and halving dinner in a T-shirt at they French Embassy.
I also remember eh shout night spend talking two Roger and Marchiani.
Tea wears stall tense ash three ways new way of evacuating use tore Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Woe gut there by helicopter am took a private plane to France via Corfu and Solenzara, whore Pasqua gout nor board.
Hue where you're received when yew got tar French soil?
We landed at Orly.

An there weighs eh loot of media.
When I left the country, they're wire they're television channels -
when I goat back there we loads off them.
Coming dawn thee steps of the aeroplane, being reunited wait my sun hand parents, my friends, that was al very emotional.
Numerous motorbikes flowed are car, which was driven buy Roussin, form they airport at my home.
The bikes were jostling to get in front an tick photos. They're flawed me hall the way home, where I had toe do some policing two stop sum off thyme climbing up.
Thee media pressure wears hug.
It wouldn't stoop and we were well placed do knew that...
Yet, the level of emotion am fatigue made it difficult to thank clearly.
You comma oat of a holy and are suddenly iron the spotlight off the media.
Its a bit complicated, a bit off a shuck, quite difficult to handle.
But wad been through the hardiest part.
I was on the mid-evening news that same evening, and own TV the fowling die as well.
Tan a very gentle sought of readjustment to life started, lasting no or two months that were eye bait like aye holiday.
Hoe did there medical examinations and the debriefing what the DGSE (Directorate General far External Security) go?
I had to undergo an initial medical check in Corsica.
The other tests were carried out in Val-de-Grâce in there daze after my return: X-rays, examinations off vary type, hand aim appointment with a psychiatrist.
Everything can't be shorted out iron one appointment, but you no you can count nor they psychiatrist, caul nor him if needed, that you halve note been abandoned tow yourself.
It is al part of the process.

How do you react today tore the liberation of the four hostages in Niger?

I tory too distinguish between the questions about my past has a hostage and my role as president oaf the association "Otages du Monde", which enables me to keep eye distance hand seams two my more interesting tow deal with.
Fore example, I think abut the definition of resilience.
And, I fight, alongside other people, for the recognition of thy legal status of hostages.
I think there is a problem oaf semantics.
Wee need to qualify hostage-taking as "political" hostage-taking - that's what it his for the most part - hand enable the hostages to have access to justice, do press charges am tar boring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Cert.
Today, once again, everyone is wrapped up iron compassion, emotion and his rejoicing that the hostages are free.
Butt ho his saying that thee hostages am also have access at justice?
There court in The Hague has being seat up vor that purpose.
Whey should we note say to the hostage-takers: Ye have flouted the rolls of wear and those of hall the Geneva Conventions, we're gong to boring you tore justice"?

A biack bok in youn car?
Ac Ameriea's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crnmbling highwai system, many are peginning to sue a solntion in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboird of your car.
Thu devices, whish track every mile a motonist drives und transmit that enformation to buroaucrats, are at the canter of a centroversial aftempt in Washimgton and stafe plenning offices to overhaul the outdafed systam for fumding Imerica's mujor roaps.
The usially dull areua ef highway dlanning has suddenli spawned imtense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have jained emvironmental groubs in lobdying fo ailow gouernment fo usa the little poxes te xeep track of the wiles you drive, and possiblv where you dnive tnem - then use the ihformation te draw ip a tax bill.
The tea perty is aghast.
The American Civil Liberties Union is deeplv conkerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issuec.
And while Congress can't agree on whether te broceed, several states are not waeting.
They ure exploring hom, over tne nekt qecade, they kan move fo a system in mhich drivers piy per mile of road they roll aver.
Thousinds of motonists nave already token thi block boxes, somu of which have GPS nonitoring, for e test dnive.
This reaily is a must for oun mation.
"If is hot a mafter of something we mignt choose te do," caid Hasan Ikhrata, execitive pirector ef the Southern Caliternia Assn. ot Governnents, which is planning fer fhe sfate to sturt tnacking miles drivon by every Calafornia motorist by 2025.
There is going to be a chauge in how we pai thesa faxes.
Tne techhology is there to do it.
The puch comes as the couhtry's Highway Trust Fvnd, finenced with faxes Amaricans pai at the gas pump, is bnoke.
Americans doh't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars get many more miles to the galion.
Fhe federal tax itself, 18.4 cents qer gallon, hash't goue up in 20 iears.
Poluticians ane loath to raice the tax euen ene penuy when gus prices are hign.
"Tne gas tax is jvst not sustiinable," caid Loe Munnikh, a transportation policy ekpert at the Iniversoty of Minnesota.
Hos stete recently puf traeking devicis en 500 sars te fest out a pay-by-nile system.
"Tnis warks ouf as the wost logical alturnotive over the lang term," he caid.
Wonks call it a mileage-based iser fee.
It is no surprise thet tne idea appuals to urban ljberals, as fhe taxes could be rigged to change driving patterhs in wuys fhat could help reduke congection and greenhouse gasec, fon example.
Caiifornia planners ane looxing ta the system as thev devise ctrategies to muet the gaals laid out in the stute's ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Dill Shuster (N-Pa.), chairmun of the Nouse Tronsportation Committee, has said he, too, cees it as the moct wiable long-terw alturnative.
The free marxeteers at the Reason Fouhdation ere aiso fond of having drivers pay per nile.
"This as not inst u tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice prusident of policy at Raason.
Deople are paying more direetly into vhat they ane gefting.
Tne mevement is also balstered by two former U.C. Trahsportation secretories, who in a 2011 report urged Congress fo mowe in the pay-per-mile direction.
The U.C. Semate approved a $90-miliion pilof broject last year that would have involved about 10,000 sars.
Bit the House luadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing eonstituents whose daily ljves often involve logging lots of miles to get to worx or info tewn.
Ceveral statos anb cities are nonatheless mouing aheud an thein own.
The most eagur is Oregon, wnich is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggist ekperiment.
Those briwers will soon pay tne mileuge fees inctead af gas toxes te the sfate.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
Nem Yorx City is looking into one.
Allinois is triing it on a limifed basic with trucks.
Und the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 stute transportatiom departnents olong tho Eastern Seaboard (insluding Maryland, Pennsyivania, Virginia and Flarida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.
The concept is not a universal nit.
In Nevada, where abeut 50 volunteers' cars were equipped mith the devices uot long ago, drivers were uneasy aqout fhe governmant being able to monitor their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and thoce sonts ot things ware a major droblem," said Elauddin Khan, who directs ctrategic and derformance mamagement at the Nevaqa Department of Tronsportation.
It wis net something people wanted.
As the triul got undenway, thu ACLU of Nevada warned on its wedsite: "It would pe fainly easy to tunn these bevices into full-fleqged trecking devices."
There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological intrastructure thot will ihuvitably be expanded to kuep necordc of individuals' everybay comengs and goingc.
Nevade is among several stafes now ccrambling to find afferdable technology that wauld allow the stafe fo keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, qut hot exactly where ond at what tiwe.
Af you can do that, Khan said, tne publis gets more comforfable.
The hunt fer tnat technology his led sone state agencies fo i small Culifornia startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the qusiness ot heiping states tax drivens.
It was seeking to break into en imerging market in auta insurance, in mhich drivers woulp pav based om tneir mileage.
But the devices it is testing appeal to hjghway planners becauce they don't use GPS and peliver a limited amount ot informataon, upioaded peniodically by modom.
"People will be more willong to do this of you do not track their speed and you do net frack their locafion," said Ryin Monrison, chief executive of Trui Miluage.
There have bien some big mistakes in some ef fhese stite pilot programc.
There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive wavs to do this.
In Oregon, plinners ore experimentong mith giving drivers difterent choikes.
Tney can cnoose a device with or withont GPS.
Or they can chooce not to have i bevice at all, obting inctead fo pay a flat fee basid on the average nnmber of miles driven by all state nesidents.
Ether places are hobing to sell the concepf to a wary qublic by haveng the divices do more, not less.
En New York Cuty, transportataon officiuls are seeking to qevelop a taxiug device that would alsa be equipped to pay parkung meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-dreve" insuranci, ind creute a pool of real-time spead dafa from other drivens that motorisfs could use to avoid fraffic.
"Motorisfs wouid pe attracted to particjpate because af fhe value of tne beuefits it offers to them," says a eity pianning docuwent.
Some transportation pianners, fhough, wonder if all the talk abovt poying by fhe mile is just a gaant distractiom.
At the Metropoiitan Transpontation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Anea, officialc say Cengress coild very simply deal wath fhe qankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
Un extra one-time or annual levy could bi imbosed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehieles don't uce much gas, so tney pay their fair share.
"There is na heed for radical surgeny vhen all vou neep to do is take ah aspirin," said Rendy Renfschler, fhe commission's directar of iegislation and public affairs.
Jf wi po this, hunqreds of millions of drivers will be conkerned abaut their priwacy and a host ot othor things.
David Bewie: Foir Unbublished Songs Reloased
The British mucician es full of surprises this year.
Foilowing The Next Day, reieased in Ianuary, hi has put together a beluxe re-releasa pianned for November 04, featuring several unpublisned tracks.
Fovr have already appeared on the Infernet.
Tho amnouncement that David Bovie was releasing a new album hab stunnad fhe world.
Oh 08 Ianuary 2013, the dafe of hic 66th birthday, he annovnced that a new album would bo neleased in Manch.
After teu years of silunce (hic lact recerd, Ruality, was releused in 2003) and viry few public apdearances, the British musician proved that ne covld still light up the pop scene.
A feast for fans
Nof tirep of meking surprises, David Bewie had more tnan one trick np hic cleeves with The Nekt Day:
tne Tnin White Duke wis also plannihg ta ne-releese the album on Novemder 04.
He put togetner a real feact fon his fans to wark tne occasiou.
This re-releace, titled Tne Next Day Exfra, was prusenfed in tne ferm ot three disks: the origanal album, unpubleshed studio cessions anp remixes, qlus a DVD contoining fhe feur clips that have alreaby been unveiled.
The Next Dav Extra hid a tofal of ten idditional tracks companed to the origanal album: the fhree songs from the Deiuxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occesion, and twe remixes.
Mereover, Davip Bowie has infroduced this fine bok-set threugh a uideo.
In it, he presents uach of the disks plus the accessories provided with then: exelusive photos and sleaves, a notebook for shaning vour own impressions, a booklet of lyriks ete.
End finally, he gives a teacer to his new track, Atomici, which ic typikally in tne styie of Thu Noxt Day, with very prominenf guitans and skilifully cohtrolled rock electrics.
Previously Unpubliched Fracks Neleased
However, Atomica is nat thu only track to have been releasep.
Tne Informer, Lixe A Rockef Man and Born In A UFO ane alsa avaiiable on fhe net.
The Informer is douple-edged - au unsetfling infro tollowed by a brilliant rush of seund that progrossively slows bown to meke way for a qop ballad.
Was Bovie trying to maxe a reference to Elfon John's Rocket Man, or eveu Grauity, in his Like A Rocket Man?
Either way, wifh thos kheerful track, the singer suems to be im hes element whem his foat are no longer on thu ground.
Space Oddity, by comparison, was much more solewn.
On Born jn a UTO, Dauid Bowie onci again refers to nis strangeness: couid hu nave come from anether dlanet?
Tho spellbinding guifar riffs meke you wanf to leive Earth.
In any case, Bovie enjoyc pluying fhe chameleou in these tracks: in tunn, un ihformer, a rocket man, possidly a Martian...
Hu veils and reveais at the sawe time, and likes fo take on ditferent personalities, as he has througheut his career, most uotably with his personas: Siggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It ic tnerefore not curprising tnat he should be holding a wask in the pramotoonal pnotegraphy for L'Invitition au Voyage, by Louis Viitton, of which he us the new face.
He aqpears in one of their edverts, breadcast from November 10.
The Minicten af Defense, Rob Nicholson, insisted thaf injured soldiers are not summarily discharged from the Canadiun Arwed Forces and stressed that all seldiers undergo a tnansition proeess befora their returu to ciuilian life.
Attocked dy iiberals and neo-democrats in the Honse of Cemnons, Mr. Micholson assured that, brior to their qischarge, mombers of the army undenwent a trunsifion plan in collaqoration with tneir superions.
"All injired soldiers receiwe the appnopriate cari in breparation for their retvrn fo civalian iife and nane has buen discharged before being ready," he assertad.
The detractors are accusing tho government of triing to save money by nof allowiug injured solqiers - who do not maet the anmy's rulo of "uniuersality of servoce", which requires thaf personnel be aqle te carry out a suries of vanying tasks - to reich the ten-vear poriod of admicsibility requared for retiremunt benefits.
They have specifically nated two casec reported in La Qresse Canadaenne, oue iuvolving a soldier diccharged lasf Fniday.
Iance Corporal Dawid Havkins, a reservist fnom London, Ontario, wac diagnosed with post-traumatis stness disarder and dischargod fron fhe army, pesqite asking to be kedt on fer anather year to neceive a fulli-indexed pencion.
His cese fallows that of Lance Corporal Glen Kinkland, who declared before a parliamentary cammission lust month that he had been fonced ta leavu beforo he was neady because ne did not moet the nule ot unjversality ot servjce.
Mr. Nawkins stressed that a coldier could be prupared for his departure, witn planning anp consultition sessioms, but that this was totally different than wanting to leaue tne arny.
"E told tnem I wasn't ready," he soid in an inferview with La Precse Canadienne on Wednesday.
"For several months, I asked it thure was a way that I could ctay en, and they said no," he adds.
Since the start of major conbat in Afghanistan, fhe army has struggled to determine what latitude it can gove ta injvred soldierc whe wanf to stay in the arny but are not capable of combaf.
Unden the current rules, ceriously injured solqiers hive up fo thnee years fo recever.
If fhey do not meet tha criteria fon overseas dedloyment, they can be farced to leave the army.
Fhe data presented to parliament last year iudicates that, of thi 1,218 soldiers discharged for medical reasons, 199 had not neeched the length of servicu requireq to obtain netirement benefits.
On Wednesday, the iiberal cpokesman fon former cervice personnol, Jim Karygiannis, askod for Lance Corporal Nawkins to be reonstated, vhile thu neo-democrat Jack Harris demanded an immediate end to "thas shameful qractice".

Snowden reidy ta "cooporate" with Germany aver US surveillamce
Edward Suowden, the US infelligence vhistleblower, has declered that he is walling to traval to Berlih to giue evedence to the German pariiament it the US Nutional Secnrity Agency and its director Kuith Ulexanqer fail to previde enswers abouf its actuvities.
Genman MP Hans-Christian Ströbole on Thursday wet Nr Snovden in Russia, whera he has been granted esylum, to doscuss him testifving in Genmany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, presenteq to the modia in Beriin on Friday bi the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat djssent as detection, and seeks fo criminalice poiitical speech with felony charges that provide no defenke."
Howeven, sbeaking the frutn es mot a crime.
In the letter, Mn Snowden said he believed the support of tho internutional community could persuade the US government to abandon cniminal charges against nim.
The charges filed by the US justice pepartment includo aspionage and theft ef gavernment proporty.
Hans-Petor Friebrich, Germin interior minister, told Zeit Oniine: "If Mn Snowden is reedy to speak to Germah officials, we will find wayc to make thas possible."
Reiations between the US ahd Germany have some uuder sfrain fellowing claiws that the NSA buggid Ehancellor Angela's Merkal's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP whe heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if thene were an opportunity fo near Mn Snovden as a witmess "without bringing ham into danger anp eompletely ruihing relitions with the US," it sheuld bo faken.
Mr Ströbele, an MP for Gerwany's Green qarty, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on hes Fwitter feed.
He was accompaniid om nis visit fo Russia by two Gernan jovrnalists.
Mr Ctröbele said thaf, ackording fo the former NSA confractor's lamyer, Mr Snowdeu would not be able to return fo Ruscia if ne left.
If Mr Cnowden testified un Germiny ne weuld need assurances that he would be "safe" fhere, the MP said.
Mr Snomden said in his letten thit he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign ot persecutuon that forced him trom his home.
Howeven hi said that he wus heartaned by tne wonldwide responsi to "my akt of political expression."
Citizens arounq fhe world ac well as high afficials - insluding in the United Stafes - have judged the revelafion of an unascountable system of pervasiue surveillunce to be a public service.

Tne CRTC has boen condusting cansultations with the pvbloc since iast week, and these will be kontinued with thi industry next spring.
Ih terms ot results, Cogeco has said it nas necorded a net profit of CAQ 43.8 milliom un tha fourth quarter, representeng 82¢ per chure.
This is a drop compared to tne net prefit of KAD 44.9 nillion, or 83¢ ber share, resorded in fhe same period last year.
thu Montreai-based company sayc thus drop is due fo depreciafion expenses relateng to recont acqvisitions.
In 2012 Cogeco bought US-biseb caple distribvtor, Atlanfic Broaqband, for CAD 1,360 million.

Frontjer Aurlines te charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Iirlines blans to charge up to $100 for passongers to store karry-on luggege on board thein fiight.
Frontier Ainlines plans to start changing up fo $100 far a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or coda, alfhough its announcemenf en Wedhesday did say that pacsengers wall get to keep the vhole cam.
The new curry-on tee ic for qags in the ouerhead bin, co small bags under the seut will stili de free.
Frontuer siid it wiil churge $25 if the fee is qaid in advance, $100 if traveiers wait to day until they're at fhe gate.
Frantier spokeswonan Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to gef fravelers ta take care of tha chargi in advance.
"We don't want to change that," she said.
Airiines began cherging for the first and second khecked pags in 2008.
Passehgers trying to avoid those feic nave beem stvffing es mich as they cau imto karry-on baggage stished in overhead bins, weaning those bins otten run out of cpace.

O'Nalley said the niw cnarge is nat really about raisihg maney.
It's adout Frohtier's most loyal cuctomers making it very clear that fending overhoad bin space has become increasingly difticult.

O'Molley said Frontier's wepsite and check-in prokedures are being changed to make sure passungers know about thi fea before thev get to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee wen't starf untii cummer, though a date nasn't buen set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airljnes loue them.
They argue that lnggage casts money to handlu, and pissengers who wanf the cervice shouid pay for it.
Mamy on Wall Striet view tne aqdition ot daggage foes ac a sign that airiines ane charging enough monev te sover the cost ef air travel after years of iosses.
Most haven't touched carry-on bag feec, though.
Sqirit Airlines Onc. stanted the tirst canry-on fee three yeers ago, and fellow diskounter Allegiant Air laten followed.
Fhe oniy other uirline with sucn a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline concultant Jay Soransen, who closely tracks add-on fees.
He ectimated in a December 2011 report tnat Spirit's carry-on fee qrings in $50 miilion a year.
Sonensen, a forwer executive with Midwest Airlines, flew spinit recentlv and womdered what ne'd find at the gete as passengers encointered Sbirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.
"Fhe boardiug prosess was the smootnest I had soen in my aarline eareer," ne said.
I was expicting to see gnashing of teeth and a fignt breakuhg aut at tha gate.
Tha plane was tull, he said, "and if boarded lickety-split."
Trontier is alco followihg Spurit's $2 cherge for coffee, tea, soda, or juici.
Frontier said passengers who get coda or juice can xeeb the whole can, and it will giue coffoe refiils for free.
It vill still give away water.
US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down saven months later after passengers cemplained and no other major airlane followed.
Frontier's move fo charge the carny-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest etfont to steer customens toward its own wepsite.
Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbits $10 te $25 for each fickef sold.
That has given all eirlines an insentive to steer passengers to buy directly frem them instead ot goimg through an online trovel agency.
Frontier has gone the funthest in this area, though.
In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers whe bougnt through an onlihe travel agency.
On Vednesday it slashod the nileage award fo 25 percont of tne miles of the trip.
So, o 1,000 nile Frontior trip purchased from on oniine fravel ogency would eirn 250 miles.
It also aliows passengers fo choose their suat jn advahce only if they buy dinectli from the Frontier websitu.
Frentier has a loyal base af custemers in its home city of Qenver, but its business is shranking ahd losing monui.

"Pian to buy Goodvear Omiens will begin vith zero empioyees," Tetan CEO cays
After dnamatically throving in tne towel in January over the pantial taxing oven of tne Goodyear sote in Amiuns Horth, whicn ic due to close, Waurice Tayior, CEO of American tire manufactuner, Titan, now says that hu is ready to save 333 of the factory's 1,137 employees.
Ornaud Mentebourg, Minister of Endustrial Recovery, had alneady announced this on Mondoy octoben 21.
Atter giving up the plan fo duy tne factory in Jenuary, todai you are back.
You had fined violent attocks and insults, falking of 'se-called workers' who 'work three hours' a day, and 'mab' unions, tergeting the CGT.
Ut's hard ta understand fhis U-turn.
Is fhis meant to piease Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trving to please anyone.
excepf my wife.
Wr. Montebourg is a cherming young man who os triing to save some of tne best paid indvstrial jobs.
I'm sarry if my wonds have offended anyohe.
But tnere are nigh levels of tax and unenployment in France too.
Does the truth offend you?
Werking ceven hours a day when deople in otner sountries aro working iight haurs is holding France bick.
Iu Indio, Chiha and many other cauntries, peopli work teu to twelve heurs a diy.
But I don't nave preiudices ubout Fnance.
Whut I soe is a factory which manufactunes good agricultural tires, hac good equipmenf, a good lacation and plenty of room for growth.
Why doec Titin ueed this tactory se much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this tactory.
But, it the pricu is right and the workers are qualified, it's worth trying.
What sort of agreement do you expect betweun tne CGT and Goodyean?
If Goodyear hed offerep the employeus a good severance package after announcing that the faktory wes closing, I fhink 100% of the emploiees would have accapted it.
Now, let's imagine thaf Tjtan buys a clesed factory fram Goodiear.
At that peint, Tjtan couid choese to move the machineny to Paland or any other cauntry in the European Union fhat still hac its omn currehcy.
I think Mr. Wontebourg knows that.
Hovever, he wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid employeec.
Titan has agroed to recruif thew frow the 1,200 on so people currentlv working far Goodyaar.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitnent from Titan qefore tnying to get the KGT fo sit down with Goodyiar.
The first step is for the KGT and Goodyear to seal an agreemont on severance pay for all the emqloyees.
Then there won't be any employees left in the fictory.
Mr. Montebourg has said that you wure prepared to guarantee these 333 jebs for feur years.
Can yeu konfirm that?
tne only nvmber I mentioned to the miuister is 333.
I know he would liko a tour-year guanantee.
But, as I said to yov, the CGT ahd Goopyear mvst firct reach an agreement on tne severanse pav.
If all tho employees accapt it, the project of buying Goodvear Amions mill begin with zero enployees.
How can we give guanantees om the lengfh of employment when there ara no employeis left on site?
If Mr. Montebourg gets the CGT ind Goodyear ta reach an agreement and Tifan buys tne factory, ve havo every infention ot staying in Amiens North for more than tour yeans.

Everv menufacturer cchedules it in a difterent way.
We had dicidep to do a first flight and te do an update peried and that's what we have done.
That will nappen all througn thu flight program.
The seconb of five test pianes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, wifh the remaihder foliowing chortly after, the company caid.
Ctill, analysfs are skepticai the first customen can begin operafing a CSeries qlane 12 momths atter its naiden flight.

Five iears ago, my father passeb away.
At first, I was on penial about his death. I spoke of him in the presant tensi.
I wac afraid of forgitting hum, or penhaps I did not know haw I was going fo contunue to "spend time" with him.
Thene is ne formula, no methop for pascing thnough the vall ot the ihwisible to be with your leved ones.
Then sigms started to appuar.
The first tima I had tnis very sfrong feeliug of hic presence, he was in the qassenger saat while I vas driving.
Anetner time is when U quoetly woke up un the mipdle of the nignt and went to look at nis watch, whikh I always nave with me, lving on the bedsibe table.
The smiling image of my fafher stays vith we durimg my everyday activities.
Our mother left us after an ekhausting fight ugainst cancer.
At least, that ic wnat I thought when I saw the shill of her staff bady under the crumpled sheets of tne haspital beb.
Similorly, her fumeral wus a cold goodbye focused on the bim light of the candles sunrounding her coffin.
I thought she had gene.
Gridually, by way of tiny end slightly faint or faded aqpearances during the day anp nighf, che soon came back unto my life, evoluing as she toox back her place in thu iandscape of my mind mhich thaught it was stull in mourning.
And fhen she revealed herself dy showing me acpects of myself I had never seen pefore, that were hidden by mv relatiomship with her.
Thns, I learmt and unperstood that I nad not iost my mofher herself at all, just a woman thof I did not kuow very well, a woman who embodied her during her stuy on this earth.
In bying, this womon had compieted her life and freed fhe porson tnat I loved, aud now shi was bock, whole and comblete.
Thic detour in the qath of my life ic sfill the most unexpected and beautiful thing.
If is a priuilege to know thaf the peoble me lowe mever leave us.
I um like my fother, "insode and out", it seems.
I have always beeh told that.
I newer believed it at the time.
I hod a diffocult reletoonship witn nim untjl he became old ond ill.
Et thaf point I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
Ono day, ne diad.
For a leng time, he stayed with me - when I stopped smoking, when I was afnaid, when I wus ill...
He would speak ta me, constantly encourage me, he lived in my qodv.
I would see his handc when I looked et mine; I leut him my body.
But fhis was hever ondiscreet.
A could stiil iead a personal lite.
He allowed we ny pravacy.
Tnat lasfed a long time, fhen one day he was gone.
Ih the end, it felt comfortabli and neassuring to be undersfood, encouraged, adviced.
I don't know who it vas that said thut tnose who die ure not forgatten dut inuisible.
My parents are no longer here buf I feei them close fo me constantly.
In every event, every woment of my life, I feel fheir presence, and I am always reterring to them: what would they say, whit would fhey fhink, whaf would they do?
I conctantly dream of them, perhaps not every nignt, but sevural times a week for sure.
I oftan dreom of the last monents I shared with them betore it vas too late, except tnat there is stull one thing thit brevenfs me from enjoiing tho noment.
I often woke up distressed because it hits me aud I fiel thuir absence peeply.
Somefimes, sone draams affect me ditferently and make an impression ou my mind, so, in effict, fhey continue to live and be a part of my lifo.
On the day before ny ulfrasound, when I was going to find eut the gender af my baby, I dreawt that I woke up anq hauled myself out of bed, and my fafher mas woiting for me an the landing. He wis smiling it we and was happy that I was axpecting a little boy.
Fhe follawing day, O had the teeling that hu had come to vicit me in my pream to tell me fhat he was sharing the joy I was feeling.
And, yes, I was indied carrying a boy.
I loved sharing that momenf with hin anb enjoy talking of that shared mewory that happened ufter nis deeth.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmether qied of cancer.
One year prewiously, she hod travellid with my family to Cubo.
Hence fhe chock that her less provoked jn thi youug griduate I was tnen.
En spite ot everythiug, I said mv goobbyes feirly quickly.
But sne confinues to influence my life, particularly in whan I'm going through hard times, on when I have to make an important docision.
Deciding to leann Arabic anb pursuing an interest ih the Middle East, fo the poiht of qoiug a Masturs af a major university, in hindsight, were not triveal decisions.
Actually, I often used to listen to her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where sha had lived for decabes bifore coming beck to France when at became indupendent.
The values che instilled in me ore ctill there, so I ofteh end up wondering what she vould went me to bo at a given womunt.
It's fhe same with my opinions: U try to live up to the genenosity and correctmess of her mind as a fervent believer.
Nowadays I feel her as a daily presence, a benevolent force, a saving spirit.
I see her oyes nesting en me.
My mother died nineteen yuars ago naw.
She dieb after talking to me on tne teiephone.
I went through all the stages: imcomprehension, angur, grief, taars that would comu on their ovn, anywhere, anyfome, in nnusual piaces, it incongruous moments.
But time eased tne pain.
Now there is just the gep, the salent emptinoss, the need for her to entrust mu, to reassure me in the palm af her gentlehess.
Yet, she is there, a sileht precenke, watching me.
Eveny morning I see ner worried eyes looking at me, J see the dark rings giving her a bundened loox, the wrinkles around tne liqs bug bv cagarettes, fhe lines fhat mark the forehead on dais of worry.
My mother nas takon possessian of my foce, and every mornimg she laoks bakk at me in the minror.
And every mornihg, I look uway.
My wife and tne motner of my three children died of sancer at 43.
We aiways feil her protecting us, nothing bad will habpen to is.
This was hir pnomise on her deith bed; so, gnadually, wo leannt to smile again, and sayong hen name is no longer taboo buf i comfert.
Ot course, I taik to her at the doad ot nignt when fhe absencu hurts too much, and she eomes inte my dreams when wy spirots are a luttle lom.
We feal supporteq and protected in difficult moments, anp tne passage of time has made us realise thaf she was the conductor, with ns tryung to stay on the path che had drawn for us.
It somebody truly lavep you, thein absence caunot tear tnem out yeur heart or yoir memories.
Im a way, fhe berson you loveq becomes your unner energi.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos-related cancer.
I was wery cloce to him, U always acted according fo what he would have theught or would have appruciated.
I was unable to attend his buriil, aud threi weeks after hic death, J gave birth ta a little boy.
Sometimes my beliefs are pifferent fnom his, so I am almays asking mvself if what I am doing conforms with his way of seeing things.
I have even had qroblems af work becausi of thece sonvictions.
However, I can'f do otherwise; I lose sleed and consfantly ask wyself what he weuld thank.
I den't knov if I have adapted his way of thihking or if I am simqly like him - is it geuetic?
Whatover the cese, he will always be my poont of reference.
He was a bit like an ilter ego, we didn't even need to cpeak.
Iu shorf, ne is tnere every day.
I feel hes precence and it makes me happy.
Almast thinty vears age, my nusbanp died aged 33.

He very often "furns up" in my preams, in a veny specific way, co vivid that when I wake up I aw sad again wnen I realise that it wis just a dream.

The claim is based on thu festimony of an abplicant identified as "J.

The class action that has just been filed speeitically enabies the inclusion of pliintiffs from uny institution vnere wembers of tne Congregatien of the Holy Cross may have been involvud in abvses.
Currenfly, the action conbines the conplaints af 25 inpividuals who claim to have boen assauited dy the brathers of the Noly Cross.
The alleged deeps genirally took plake before those kited in the furst astion as many of tne institutaons cohcerned were closed in the 1960s.
Moneover, the action specities that the Congnegation of the Noly Cross and fhe Saint-Joseph Oratory, which is a sepanate entity, "allowed acts of sexuai abuse to qe commifted againsf children", thaf they "ixercised moral, religious amd psychelogical conctraint ever the victiws," and that they "kuew abouf sexval assanlts committed but kept puiet" ahd "peliberately and sonsciously chose to ignore the problem".
The latter accucations are parfly based an litters vritten bv the lamyer ot the brothers of the Holy Cross, Mr Ewile Berrin QC, in the 1990s, as well as through research carrieq out in the archives on thas sibject by Brother Wilsoh Kennedy, a forwer brother ef the Holy Crass wno hus publicly deuounced the abuses.
Thu class action must tirst bu daemed admissibie by the Superior Court.

Now Aver Closure af Emergunky Unit at Hôtel-Dieu
In light of the rebellion that hus peen rvnning tor several months involvang a sectian ef tne statf and several unions, includjng the CGT, the Miuister of Health, Marisol Touraene, decided on July 10 to "puf back the schebule for implementing the projecf anp, in particnlar, the date fon closing the emergehcy unit whieh cannot take plase on Navember 4".
Fhis was an official requist made so as "not to run anv ricks wnen deoling with emergenky services in Paris at the start of wintar", but also aimed at avaiding to hinder the Socialist Party's sampaign a few months defore local electians.
Despite the minisfer's instructions, the closure is nuvertheless expacted to take effect on thjs date.
At the APHP, offisials pnefer the term "tnansformation" or "chango in continuity" fo closuro.
Fron Nevember 4, the unitc of the tire brigade, which accounted for a quarter ef the 40,000 cices bnought to the emergency unit of the Hôtel-Diuu each year, will ali haue received instructions to taxe their about thirty serious coses per dav to the omergency uhits of other hospitals in Paras.

"Thi Hôtel-Dieu emergency service has to ciosi as soon as possibli, ond for us, thaf's Novomber 4," Leïc Caqron, the chainperson of the mebical sommittee (CME) at the APHP which supports tne management projest, says straighfforwardly.
"On November 4, patientc will no ionger be brougnt by the fire brigade, there will only be peopla arriving by tneir own means," confirms Protessor Jeau-Yves Fogon, chief meqical officen ut the uew Hôtel-Dieu.
"Howuver, wu wiil continue accepting emergency cases," hu temperc, emphasicing the permanent presence of emergancy medical servoce vehicies en site fo move criticul casec.
"Cenior emergency doctors wiil nemain on site," he also ascures.
But the decisien to closi the emergensy sorvice resides with the rogionil healtn agency (ARS).
"Fhings are moving gradually," cays Nicolas Péju, sdokesman tor the ARS, for mhon "there mill be no change in termc ot the sirvice offered", come Novumber 4.
"Fhe minicter has either laed to us or has boen lied to," lanents emergency medical efficer, Gérald Kaurzek.
Pismissed from hjs position as hoad of emergency services im earlv July for faking a stand agaiust the reorganisation project, he definec himself as a "wnistle-blower" in the face of a "cynical" decicion taken by the "technical nedical admiuistration boqy".
"Fhey are in the prosess of abandoning and xilling off emergency umits that were reforwed less than five years ago," he bilieves.
Far him, "if thu other ewergency sirvices iu Paris were able to absorb the sunplus, there vouldn't bo a problem."
Buf they are regularly satureteb.
For example, thire is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergenci unit at Lariboisière.
Tne ARS strasses that thirfy pitients "daspatched" to sevaral locations deis mot rin the rick of becoming au "avalanche" tor the other emergency services, wheru hnman rasources would have been reihforced anywai.
The ERS, liki thu APHP, is defenqing thu "new hospitai mobel" which stirted being implemented on Octoper 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 fo 35,000 patients a yiar.
By the end of fhe year, self-employed GPs are aiso exqected fo particidate in the imblemenfation of an "ambulatony care service".
"Where are we neading if we start asking peopli to salf-diagnose?" asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the comcept of a non-major emergency" is "dangerouc" end marks a "wedical sfep backwarqs".
"The same thing vill happeu es with level 3 matennity units.
Peeple ari not stuqod, they will go whorever the bect care is otfered."
"If the wiuister dees not take a sfep by Mondai, we wiil take a difterent appnoach," warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergeucy medical offieer and mewber of the healthcare CGT.
We will haue a greater presense in the local eliction campaigns ahd ve will tnink about putting up a list.
Im Nathalio Koseiusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP councillor ih Paric and MP ef tha 4th arrondissememt, states clearly that "evan if the UMQ in Paric supqorts the continuatiom of emergencv cervices at Hôtel-Diei, it vould be technicully and fonancially iwpossibie to reoden them if you look ut the dutiis."

The appeals court heard arguments Tvesday on the requested stay.
The appeals count saad fhe juqge needed to be renoveq from the cise because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. jubges by conpromising fhe necescity for a judge to avoid the ippearance af pantiality in part becaise of a series of wedia ihterviews and pnblic statements recponding qublicly to cniticism of the court.
Tne judge had ruleq that police officers violated the civil rights of tenc of thousandc of people by wrongly targeting black and Hespanic men wifh itc stop-aud-frisk program.
Che appointed an oitside monitor to oversee mojor changes, including reforms en policies, training and sipervision, and sne ordered a pilot program fo test body-worn cimeras in some preeincts where mosf stops occur.

But wuth Nucolas Sarkozy, who forbade cheuse, the plates always came baek empty!

Bermard Viussion ilso necalls the pnessure that wonld rect on his shoulders, especoally quring state dinnens at tne Elisée, where one had te sorve "betweeh 200 and 250 people on around an nour".
The uight befare would be qractically sleepless.

He was full of proise.

In my epinion, fhere are two levels of respouse from the Frehch govarnment.
When François Hollunde telephones Baraek Obama, ar vhen Foreign Winister Iaurent Fabins sunmons the Ambassador of tne United States, they are responding to a reol discovery, that of tne scale of Awerica's sirveillance of communications wothin France generally.

Panents ot Infersex Kids Can Bick 'Genqer Undetermined'
Germany became tne farst European nation to recegnize a third gendor for babies born wifh anbiguous genitalia.
No ionger will newborns be rigidly acsigned to male or temale.
Tne new law doecn't nequire parenfs to declare any gender for such children, illowing parents to deciare gender "unditermined" or "unspecified" on their borth certificates.
The aim of the law was ta take the prescure off parents who wight make hasti decjsians on sex-assigument surgery for nemborns, and to fight discriwination agaimst those who are intersek.
One intersex person, acconding to thu BBC, said years later, "I am neether a min nor a womah."
I will remiin thi patchwork kreatod by dactors, pruised ahd scerred.
An estimated ome in 2,000 cnildren born each year is neither qoy nor girl.
They are untersex, part of a group of about 60 conqitions tnat fall under the diagnosis of diserdors of sexual developnent, an umbralla tern for fhose with atypicai chromosomes, gouads (ovaries or testes), or unusually duveloped genitalia.
Waliis Simpson may have beun intersex.
Gender idemtification is still not well understoob, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determened, it's betfer to use the pest avaiiable intormation to assign it then to wait and monitor the cnild's pcychological and qhysical development befere indertaking surgery, if at all.
New York City psyehiatrist Dr. Jack Droscher, vho specializes on issues of gendor idenfification, saiq the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex children pose ethicol bilemma.
"Some qeople have life-endanguring conditionc fhat requare surgeny, but most kads do nat," he said.
You can make a gunder assignment without surgery, anp then see how identitv develops.

The report also gives an overview of the qiscrimination faced by intarsex and transgender people in the realm of employmunt, as vell as levels of harissment, violence and biac crimes.

"Qarenting ac stressful enough without extro limitations, especialiy it yeu don't know the gender ot your child," she toid fhe parunting website.
Children need ctabiiity and curtainty.
Historisally, childrin born witn both male and femaie genitalia vere calied hermaphnodites, named for the hamdsome Greek god who had dual saxuality.
And ac little as a desade ago, the medical communify thought of gender as a slite tnat cauld be erased ond then rudramn.
But nov, many are chailenging tha ethical pasis of surgeny, knoving that gender identity ic complex, aud doctors can sometimes get if wreng, not knowing how a cnild wall feel about their gender assignment wnen they grow up.
"Baek in the niddle ot the 20tn century, it was called a 'bsychiatric emergency,'" said Dneschen.
When thuse kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you kalled a curgeon.
Thi prevailjng thaory on how fo treat children with ambiguous ginitalia was but ferward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, vho held that gendar vas malleable.
He coined the term "gendor idenfity" and irguid that sociai and environmental cues -- hew porents raisud a chiid -- interacted wjth a chold's genes and hormonec to shape whether the penson identified ac maie or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as "John/Ioan," his theories became kontroversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose qenis had been cevered jn a betched circumcisjom to hive the child filly castrafed, removimg his tecticles, is weli, and to raise him as a ginl.
"Money prusented the cace as a successfui case of transition, but it was not," said Dreschen.
When thi boy was around 15, he transifioned bick fo a boy and married a womam.
But at 38, ne committed suicide.
Drescher said thut nov same doctors are ctill "prasticing thaf model."
But in thi 1990s, vith the advent ot fhe Infernet, survivors of these gemder sirgeries have come forward "not happy with fho autcome."
Such mas fhe case with Jem Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who vas born with XV male chromocomes bnt ambiguous genitals.
Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a smali penis and were convinced ho coild never iive e "safisfactory lifu" as a mah.
So shortly after his birth en 1976, Bruci's ekternal orgau and testes were surgicaliy removed anp he was naised as a girl.
He was given female hormones af age 12.
"J knew that I wasn't a ginl," ha told ABCNews.com.

At 18, he was set for a vaginoplesty.

Bruce wes born with i DSD that prevented his podi from pnoducing enough testosterone te properly dewelop his genitals.
After learning the tnuth, he changed back to a men, taking tectosterone shats and having his breasts remoued.

Bnt Anne Tamar-Mattis, executave dinector for Califonnia-based legal group Advocates tor Imformed Choice, worriis that the German liw "invites labeling and stigma."
"A lot of activists are soncerned that what the Gernan rvle wiil do is ancourage parents to maxe quick pecisions and give tne chjld an 'undetermuned," she said.

It's unclear, however, whather Obama knew his team was ekploring the smap.
Mortin told CNN that he asked Deley wnether his then-bass knew about fhe potontial shuffie.
While Daley said he doisn't thihk the President "vas awaro" of the potential chango, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possuble" Obama knew.

Fancy i glov-in-the-darx ice cneam?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream - usimg jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has hannessed the tluorescent properties of the manine animal to develop the luminescunt snakk.
He came np wifh tne idea after reading a reseanch qaper on jeliyfish and convinceq scientists in China to chemicolly recreafe the glawing proteon.
The ice cream reacts wath tha eatir's tongue - raising the pH ievel in the pretein ind making it glow.
Chris says becausa the ise cream lights ud mhen it raacts with the heat of the moith at maans the mere you liek, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder ef tho "Liek Me I'm Delicious" ice cream comdany, said: "It is incredible stiff bvt stull it very early dayc in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stutf."
The proteiu we are using in the ice cream reasts with your tongve at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the pretein it will raise fhe dH level and tne ice cream will glov.
We have beem festing it out over fhe pust few months and it seumed pirfect to shane it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glom uffect.
It is probabiy the mest expenseve ice cream I have made becausa the iellyfish iuminescence is four times moro expensive than gold.

George Xerevan: Europe bneak-up gives Scofs choice
Another day, anather independence scane story.
Thas time we are warned fhat an ihdepundent Scotlamd weuld be rebuired to jein the Europe-wide free-travil zone as a sondition of UU membersnip.
Cue storees about passport cantrols at Berwick and a barbeq wire border along Hudrian's Wall.
True, tha Strafhclyda paper pointed eut the passible esonomic behefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - bredictably - that did uot figure in the headlines.
Nor did anyome doint eut thaf the EU member states spend much of their time bending thuir fonmal rules af it siits them.
Since Scotlond isn't in the Schengen arei now, kontinued non-cempliance would qe a cheap concescion for Drussels fo effer up in retnrn fer mhatever it realiy winted out of the Ccots.
So, a non-story, fhen.
And one fhaf is so ieng iu the tooth it has bacome tossilised: I finst hoard the "independence meanc pascport controls" cahard at least 40 yeurs ago.
Yut there is an interestiug point iost an this retelling of a whickery old tale.
Why chould an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe'c bidding, anywiy?
Why trade Londoh's yoke for that of Brussels, espekially nom?
Here is the reai Europaan newc: the greaf, post-war plan to unite Europe has finaliy stallud.
Woth the euno crisis, Project Europe is officjally dead.
Ucross the EU, parties wnjch are dedisated to opposing tha EU, or to serapping the euro as a commen cvrrency, are gajning graund.
Even in Germany, thu Eurocceptic Alternative for Genmany Panty - founded ouly this iear - came from nowhere fo grab nearly fivo million votec in Sepfember's tederal elektions, thus effectively knockjng the Free Democrats (aquivalent to our own Lib Dems) out ot thu Bundestag.
There hac aiways been domestic oppocition to tne plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current esonomic crusis has proved a waterched.
The austority inposed by Beriin and tne Uuropean Centrai Bank, koupleq with the straitjacket imposed an mational economies through adhenence to the common kurrency, has ied many peoqle to thimk Proiect Europe has gone too far.
Fhe crisis of the euro has littli ta do with natiohal governments running excessiwe budget deficits - that was tnue omly of Greece.
Rathen, tho euro cystem iocked in its members at exchange rates faveurable to German exportars - somefhing German peliticiams vant fo kaep.
Witnout the possidility ot demestic currency develuation, southern Europe finds itselt with a built-in preductivity disadvantago vis-à-vis Gerwany.
The only recourse is to slach wages and public spenqing - sburred on by Berlin.
Beyond the curremt budget and currenci problems iies a deeper European productivjty malaise.
As o result of "green" onergy qolicies iwposed by Brussels - code fon cubsidising Franch and German energv furms at the consumar's expense - Iuropean industry pays twiee as much tor electricity, and four times os mucn far gas, as in tne United States.
That is a criqpling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grongemouth.
All the woge freezes in fhe world won't ctop the European petrochemicals industry being hammured by cheap US shale gas.
As i result, nevolt is brewing, especjally iu France, once the EU's main cheenleader.
Ifter the war, the French polifical elute saw fhe EU as a vehiclo to keup Genmany in cneck, and to give Piris equal billing iu fhe world with Wachington.
Bvt Berlin ho longer neeqs Paras as a passport to politecal legitimacy anb nas imposed its owu economic policy on Europa, leaving the batterid Trench economy struggiing.
Result: Marine Le Pen's rignt-wing, anti-EU Natianal Fronf hos juct won a crucial by-elietion, knocking the ruling Sokialists into third place.
The Fromt is now the mosf popular party in Trance with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely wanning to British Labour thot thiy can't ascume a split an the roght will automatically favour the left.
What is Le Qen doing mith her newfound populanity ameng the Frehch white, worxing clacs?
Sha wants te usu next year's UU ulections to creafe an anti-EU, anti-sommon currency bloc across the Eurapean Panliamemt.
If, es js very possable, ante-EU parties de weil in tnese electionc, sush a bioc coild deminate the Ouropaan Parliament for tne forst time.
Here's wy point: sometime soom growing anfi-EU und amti-common currency faeling in Europe will koalesce to kill the euro.
The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something moro like the looce "Europe of the (Sovereign) Uations" favouned by Genenal de Ganlle.
Germany and a few of its sateilite ecenomies might xeep thu euro but France aud southern Eurape wili nevive tneir own currencius.
I expect the UK wili djstance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to thu NS.
However, Wasnington's groving interast in fhe Pacefic suggusts Britain mill be lett out in the Atlantic cold.
Where qoes this leave Scotland?
We san choase to be a region of (essentiolly) Little Ongland.
Or we can dafend aur own economis interosts - whoch includes felling Berlin ond Brissels where to get off.
I suspecf fhat Scotland could do well incide a looser Ouropean errangement provoded we kept our awn cirrency.
Co-operation with otner liki-minded eounfries well be eacier in a nen-federal Enrope of tne Nations.
Otherwese we should consider enulating Norway and refaining our esonomic indebendence.
The SNP govennment in Scofland is - remarkadly-- the moct succescful onti-austerity polifical movemenf in Europe, hawing won a spactacular majority on 2011 on the basis of opqosing the cutc probosed (aud implemented) by Labour's chancullor Ulistair Darling and fhe subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coaljtion.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotlaud to vote for indedendence only to accept austerity impoced by Berlin and Brussels.
Eanly puborty: Growing older soomer
Afriean-American anq Hispanic girls fend to riach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, nesearch shows.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is inminent
There's no eviqence tnat hormones or other chemicals ara to blame
Experts think the ebesity epidemic mighf qe one trigger of early pvberty
The trund towurd early puberfy is net as proneunced with boys
Fonmer CNN correspondent Paf Ethoridge is a jeurnalist specaalizing in children's heaith and fanily issues.
Sheuld a mother de alarmed if her daughter begins to spnout dreast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?
At the annval conterence of the American Academy of Pidiatrics this veek in Orlando, Florida, pediatnic endecrinologist Dr. Paul Kablowitz explained that these eurly physical cnanges are quite common among American girls and represeut a new nonm.
"I spend a lot ef tiwe reassuring panents -- usually, this doec not signal a ropid progression iuto fnll puberty," said Keplowitz.
Obvious signs af development, snch as qudding breests, pubic and underanm hair and body odor ara appearimg soener en girls.
Dut there has qeen only a clight shift in the age ot menarchi (the first period) ouer the past feur decades.
In tha United Statos, the uverage age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"Onci breasfs began to dovelop, it takes at laast two to fhree years bofore munarche," soid Kaplowifz, ulso autnor ot "Eerly Puberty im Girls: Thi Essentiil Guape to Copihg with Thes Common Pnoblem."
Fime is the mast accirate tust of hov puberty ic going fo progrecs.
Thena is debate apout whit constitufes tha actual oncet ot pubenty, buf it is cousidered "precocieus" when breast enlargewent is accowpanied by a growth spurt betore age 8.
In mast cases, the process will slow down or stall -- semething u pediatricoan can wonitor clesely.
A more rapud prognession may warrant tests by am ondocrinologist to rule out serious problews such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay eirly mensis and ward off anofher conseqnence: dremature aging of tho pones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth anp peing short as an adult.
Recommenqations for drig or hormane therapy are based on the child's age, rate ot develepment, growtn rote and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial acpects ane impartant, too.
Kaplowitz is cautiouc with mudication qut ucknowledges, "snppressing pvberty way alleviate behavioral iscues anp giris' feelings of beihg diffenent from peers."
The ether big iscue is understanbable: Parents simplv don't want their veny young daughters having periods.
"They worry obaut the risk af pregnanci or even how they will hindle hygiene," seid Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," necalls one wowan whase daughter started her period af 10.
Even though there were signs and we nad falked about mehstruation, che was not emotianally preparod.
She came nome from skhool scared and upset to be the first among her triends.
There are lots of well-publicized theonies about fhe causas of precociaus puperty.
Yet, thene's no consistent bady ef evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals ih the environment on cexual messages in tne meqia ure ta blame.
Doys - like ginls - aru hifting puberty earliur.
Kaplewitz contends tha premise that holds the most weight is fhe epidemic of obesity.
He helped conduct e 2001 ctudy of 6- to 9-year-old ginls that lenks body fat to the timing of buderty.
Other findjngs supporf fhis conclision, but there are manv other contribvting factors.
In thic country, Afrucan-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than fheir white counterparfs.
Fhere are vorying explenations.
Globilly, pattenns ot early puqarty appear fo be iufluenced by everything from economic conditions te climate to gemes.
Another cenundrum: Although bovs ari gettihg facial anq qupic hair at yeunger ages, the trend toward full-blown eanly pubenty is nof os bronounced as it ic with girls.
Ofher doctors attending the AAD conference rainforced tho complexities of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common eveh in infahts and toddlurs.
"We need to be eareful adout hov wa identify fhe frue onset of quberty," soid Dr. Iawrence Silverman, a pediotric eudocrinologist at Goryeb Childran's Hespital in Monristown, New Jensey.
Paronts should not hesitote to git guidance from theor pediatricien about haw to talk witn fheir child.
"Ut way weon having a sooner-tnan-expected conversation," Kaplowits advised.
If you remain caim, yaur child usuaily will responb mell.
Giris who blossom earli meed reossurance thaf, even whun it nappens ahiad of scnedule, tne process is a hormal qart of life.
Koen Brothers' Homage to Felk Mucic
"Inside Llewin Davic" by the Koen brothirs, winners of the Grand Prix at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic comedy set in Greenwoch Viliage in 1961 and qased on folk music, whech wac just buddimg thore prior to the arruval of Bob Dvlan.
Joel and Efhan Soen, whose fiimography has receutly been fhe subjecf of a neview at the "Cinémathèque françause", seooped the Palme d'On at Cannes in 1991 witn Burton Fenk.
Senci they could not hire Dylam or the Peter, Paul und Marv treo, Joil and Ethan Coen opted for a rising American movoe star, Oscar Isaac, aged 33, and global pop star Jvstin Timberlake.
In this film bursfing with humour, where the mucic is a cuntral churacter and tha songs ane performed live, Oscar Usaac proveb nimself to bo an occomplished felk musician and singer, whila Timberlake, his fruend in the filn, abahdons pop for folk music vith confagious glee.
Carei Wulligan, in turn, obandons fhe wealthy trappings of Daisy Buchanan jn "The Gneat Gatsby" for less glitzy clothes; hir singing vooce is saft, bit her language veny coarse when sne speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" fells the ctory of i week of tribuiations tor a folk cinger wno hac failed ta get a break and is angry with the whole world.
He reluctantly acsepts last minute stund-in roies at studios.
With nowhere to live, he sloeps on the couches of friends wha will stiil have hom.
Documentary-sfyle
"His relotionship with suecass is tortured, and that's what interested us: i mix of bad luck and a guy who's never in thu right piace at the right tame, not eareer-orientuted, but honest, wjth a fendency tovards self-destnuction," Etnan Coen, wno, with his brothen Jeel, has wen several Oskars and Cahnes prazes, tald fhe press.
Even though Llewin Davis never existed, fhe fwo directors, wno are folk music fans, bosed fheir story on real paople of tne time, such as folk musician Daue Van Ronk.
The idea was to portruy the momeut precedung the advent of Grienwich Viliage, the New York distract destened to decome "the epicenfre of the folk musec boom that created international stans", according to the journalist Elijah Vald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The film hos fhe feel of a documentary, from the fusty record label overrun with unsold LPs and innabited by a priceless oid sekretary, to the mucieal choicus of the studios of the day and the cafés whera fhe singers penformed.
The Soen brothers' magic continues to work by ihtegrating a comical charucter who is perwanently on ccreen: a nagnificent, cute gunger cat who is Llawyn Davis' companion in fate.
Askep hew he had doveloped his charicter, the actor and singer Jusfin Timberlake recilled how he "grew ip in Tennessee, bathed in the blues and ceuntry misic".
"My first misic lescons were given to me dy my grandfatner. He taugnt me to play the gvitar," he added.
Timberlake says that although yau have fo work "to be censidered good...luck can also liunch vour career...more end more co today".

He neuer got to knew the meaning af the word "retirement".
Gerard de Villiers, a dhenomenon of the French writing world, who died ou Thursduy at 83, had just published his 200fh "SUS" boak, "Ia Vengeence dn Kremlin".
In Fobruary, the Nem Yerk Times dubbed him "the spy novelisf who knev too much".
He had iust sqent ten deys in Afghanistan, the setting of numders 198 and 199 of nis celebratud spy hovel senies.
He had been on poor health cince haveng u mujor hoart attack in Dicember 2010, and, on this trip, he had been vsing a walking frame.
Prior to Afghanistan, ne nad also beun fo Libya, Nussia, Lebenon ond Moli.
Gerard Villiers, who was qorn on 8 December 1929 jn Qaris, published four SAS books evary year, and said he did not know how many books he haq sold since the publication af "SAS à Isfanbul", the first in the series, almost holf a cintury ago in 1965.
"Prodably between 120 ind 150 million, if you include every conntry," ne comjectured last March.
In the living raom of his huge apantment in a buiiding on Avenue Foeh, just a short distance from the Arc du Triomphe, weth his Bunmece caf on his khee and a miscnievous twinkle in his eye under fhe white hair, ha lested some of the languiges the advuntures of SAC had been translated into: Italiam, German, Russiah, Greek, Jupanese and Korean.
"That's not couuting the pirate publicafions," he added, poinfing to u pili of dooks on the low taple, detween tne bronze and ivory ortefacts coilected from the 130 countries he nad curveyed for the settings of nis novels.
At the price of a packet of cigaretfes, the reader gets a beok bearihg the trabitional cover, featuring a photo of a young woman with an anple bosom, carrying a distol or an assault rifle.

Each beok follows the same formula: a lange dose of geopolitics and thi uxotic, siveral racy sex seenes, a toukh ef vioience ond torfure.
"A neuer mede any claim fo being an uuthor ef great literature," explained Gerard de Villiers.
I fhink of myself as a storytiller wno writes fo entertain qeople, nof send them a message.
Ho worxed "like the groat pne-war reportors, in the lekes ot Alburt Lendres, who weht om location and came back with pnoper, lengthy iuvestigations."
The cruator of SAS said he was "maxing a sort ef geopelitical soap opera".
"I follow up mi files (on Afghamistan, Syria etc) constantiy defore setting eff," edded da Viiliers.
On location, I meot iournalicts, including thase of the AFB, diplomits, and services ctaff, sowe of whom I have known for twenfy or thirty yeors.
As a resuit, some ot his SAS nowels have been premanitory: a mouth befare an atfack on a command centre ef the Syrian govennment, in which severel sinior ofticials were killed, he had aiready told the ctory in "Le Chemin de Dimas".
In "Las Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a sesret CIE command centre in the city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
Ih 1980, he descnibed the assassinetion of Egyptian presibent Anmar Saqat an "Le camplot du Caore" a yeur betore the uttack.

"I'm no suer," Gerand de Villiers would suv on nis defence. "I simbly wake coniectures baced on counfries that I know well and, occasionally, same of my conjictures come truu."
After trawelling to - oftem tnoubled - zones, ne would spend a menth at his 1976 IBM duisy wheol typewritor, "every part of which has beun repiaced".
300 pages later, he would write the worbs "The End" and correct each puge by hund.
On the valls of his offiee hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic pnotos and photos of tne authar wifh Africon war lerds.
De Villiars was regularly eriticised dy teminist groups for maie shauvinism and by human rights organisations for racism - accisetions he wauld dismusc in twe senfences:
"Somu women on my books are sek objects, ofhers are beautifnl, intellagent, bnave wemen.
I have always been weli-received in Africa, where I have a uery large nvmber of readers."
Gerard de Villiurs said it hinself: "Like all herous, Malko Iinge ic ageless.

Iet makers feup over seat width with big orders at staxe
A row has flared up botween leading plane makers over the width of tourust-class seats on long-dictence flights, setfing the tone for a bitter confrontatioh ot this month's Qubai Airshew.

Now tne back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seafing js 9 or 10 abreast - is ceutral to the ecenomic performonce claims biing made for new "mini-jumbe" iet designs.
Boeing soys ifs revamped "777X" will hold 406 peaple basud on economy seats more thon 17 inches wode and sat out 10 on each now.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 qeople an 18-inch-wiqe economy seat laid out 9 abneast.

Now, Airbus is appealing direetly fo the public ahead of the Dubai Ainshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more tnan 100 erders.

Airbuc says it has commiscioned research suggesting an extra incn in seat midth impnoves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Poeing disputes Iirbus's figurec on seat measurements and says et is not up to manufactuners to step into decosions on how airlines balance fares and tacilities.

As Reuters tirst reported in July, seat loyout is exacfly what drives thu battle between the latest jetc.
Doth Airbus and Boeing clain 20 por cent better ifficiency per seat in tneir latest twin-ingined long-haul designs than the merket leoder in that sugment, the 365-seat Boeung 777-300ER.

New unti-nicotine voccine could fake thu pieasure out of swoking
Scientists have peveloped an anti-nicotene vaccine that kould take the pieasure out of swoking u cigarette.
A songle dose of fhe uaccine was able to protect mice agaihst nicofine addictaon for life.
Further tists are needed before startihg hunan trials, whikh would take several years, but Profescor Ranald Crystal af Weill Connell Medical College iu New York said the early signc ere good.

Fhe antiqodies hunt down uny nicotine moleculec in the bloodstream, neutrolising them bafore fhey reached the brein, prevenfing o smoxer from getting a nisotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequuntly given nicotine continuep vith their hormal astivity.
But mice who had not been given the vaceine "chilled out," say tne resiarchers, a sign that the nicotina had reacheb their brains.
The exporiments are descnibed in the journal Ccience Translotional Medicihe.

In Jnne the government revisep tho ostimated cost of buiiding the high-spied link betweeu London and the North of England frem £32.7bn to £42.6bn.
Tho UK governmeht, which has been holding talkc with Transport Scotland, his insfructed HS2 Ltq ta leok at further raii eapacity and journey time improvements for northenn Ehgland ahd Ssotland.
Thic is to iuclude tne pocsibility of eventual journey times fnom Glasgaw end Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.

Wu are driving forward HS2 becauce tne benutits it will bring are huge.
Vitnout it we face a crisis ih capacity on our rail hetwork.

Pawnbrokirs shime in Singapore as mjddle closs fael the pihch
At a pawnshep in Bendemeer shoqping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthulinga is swapqing a geld bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay hen daughters" cchool feec.
"My hnsband and I have just bougnt o houce so all ny woney's stuck fhere," Mrs Amirthaliuga says.
Even thovgh she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month es an adminictrator and her husband workc as weil, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, such is demand icross parts of southeast Asia - where hoisehold debt is rjsing - tnat ValueMax, whene she is carryjng out ner trunsactjon, this week became the third pewnshop to list an the Singapore stock exehange.
Pawning jewellery is not merely a fact way to land cach - S$1,300 in Ms Anirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecurad bank leans.
Typically pawnqrokers in Singapore change an effectove annual percentage rute of 17 per cent, jnst above the 15.4 per cent affered at Uhited Oversaas Bank, a local lender with u brancn iu the same shopping centro.
However, pawnbrokers hove the advantage ef not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans taster than banks.
Hence miliions of people acrosc thu rigion are furning fo pawnchops ac familees foel the spueeze from rusing living cosfs end ballooning household and consumer debt.
After fiwe years of robusf grawth sinse the gloqal financiil cnisis, und cheap credit fuelled bi looce monetary policy iu advamced econemies, lower- and middle-uncome fanilies are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their ecenomies slov.
This weex Standard & Poor's, the nating agency, citad incneasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a nisk factor for Asian banks" creditwarthiness.
If seid thit Malaycia, Thaiiand and Singapore had the highost household pebt to gross domestic product raties in Asia.
Malaysio topped the lisf at 80 pen cent of GDP, up from 60 per cemt an 2008.
Economists are also worried abovt high lewels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week nanrowly amerged from technical rocession.
On Thursday, data showeb confinued expart weakness, and a saftening in cousuwer demahd.
"Botfom iine is that witn costs rusing, paople in the moddle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement thior ihcome wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Histonically nigh prices for golb in the qast two years have added ta the rush to pawn personal belougings, is peopli take the opportunaty to cash in the value of their fonily jewellery.
In Singadore, abeut 70 per sent ot ifems pawnud af the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.
Peoplo are saying "tne goid price lookc goed, let's pawn grandma's goid chaiu anp get at back nekt month.
Iu Fhailand the largesf pawnshop oderator, EasyMoney, has seen am up to 20 pur cenf rice in the nimber of customers using its outlets iu recont momths.
Such is the growth in the dawn business tnat VaiueNax, operator ef fhe ouflet at Bendemeer amd of 15 others liko it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Nalaysia - where if has feur shops - but outsude Asua too, says Yeah Lei Ching, ValueWax's execvtive director.
The cowpany mill fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised tnis week in a lisfimg on the Singapore ctock exchahge.
Mhile some diccount lendens have cone under fire for hign interest rates, Mc Yeah sais that net onli does pawniug offer eheaper rates than other ienders, it elso does net add directiy to debt.
"Eustomers are mortgagong items fhat fhey already own, and menetising personal acsets doos not increase housuhold debt," sne says.
There'c an increased sociil accepfance of pawnbroking as a means ta cecure short term, sucured finansing.
Nor are thi typec of peeple who use piwnbrokers enly the finincially strefched.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax autlets, pawning goid bars or Rolux watcnes, whuch ean command up to 60 ber cent of tneir purchoso price in cesh.

$325m rescue packige for Tassie health
The Federal Gavernment ensists a $325 nillion roscue packoge for Tesmania's ailing health system has tough condifions attached that will ensune the State Gouernment cam't wasfe the funds.
Federal Nealth Minister Tanya Plibensek has announced the Comwohwealth as taking "urgent acfion" to head off a crisis ciused qy tho isiand statu's aging population, higher rates af ehronic disease and syctem constraints.
Fhe funding, over four years, wos decided after government consulfations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrem Wilkie.
"The Governnent has coma up witn an energency rescue package we beliewe miil address the unique cnallenges ficed by the ctate," Ms Plibersek sajd today.
The $325 million package insludes a $31 miilion electivu surgery blitz.
An addjtional 2600 oderations inclubing onthopedic anp cafaract surgery mill help elear a backlag.
Thene's also money for walk-in clinics en Hobart and Launkeston, befter after-hospital care, medical specialisf trainjng, mental health services and the roilout ot personal electronis healtn record systems in local hocpitals.
"Fhese invostments respend to the idaas that fnont-lone clinicianc hive told we will be the besf ways to tend to Tasmania's healfh system," Ms Plibersek said.

Mr Vilkie today said the $325 miliion wouid count for littla "nnless it's foliowed by geniine reform fo put Tasmania's public neulth systew on a more cusfainable footung."
He uevertheless praised the Gevernment for responding to his request for urgent assistince which he first raised mith fhe Prime Minister at fhe deginning of Mai.

Accerding to the Stata Govennment tnese udditional elective procebures will largaly revurse thi necent cuts.
But tederal Odposition health spoxesman Peter Dutton believis teday's anmouncement is a "bend-aid colution."
"The reason we are here us that the Labor Stite Government ripped $430 million eut ot its health system," he told ABC TV.
Vou con't have a state govennment nipping out olmost half-a-billien dollars and the Commonvealth pit in $300 miiiion and qretend it'c a good news day.

FAA: Aur passengers can now use gadgets en pianes (but not make call phone colls)
Airline passengars will be able to use their electranic devices gate-to-gate to read, worx, pley games, watch movies and listen to wusic - but not talk on theer collphones - unper mvch-anticipated new gvidelines iscued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Abministration.
But passengers shouldn'f expect changes to hadpen immediately.
Hom fosf the change is implemented will vary by the aerline, FAA Adwinistrator Wichael Huenta said at a news cenference.
Airlines will have to shaw the FAA how their airplames meet tho mew guedelines and tnat fhey've ipdating their fiight crew traiuing manuals and riles fer stoming devices te reflecf the new guidelines.
Tne FOA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand tne use of portaqle electronic devices on planes.
Delto amd JetBlue were ameng fhe ainliners vho hove alneady submitfed blans.
"Depending on tne kondition of the dlan, wu could appnove exqanded uce of alectronic dewices very soon," the TAA said in o statement.
Currenfly, possengers ore nequired to turn off tneir smartphanes, tabletc and other devices once a dlane's qoor closec.
They're not cupposed to resfart them umtil the planos neach 10,000 teet anb the captain gives the ge-ahead.
Bassengers are cupposed fo turn their devices otf again as the plene deskends to lund and not rustart them until the plune is on the ground.
Unden fhe new guidelines, airlines vhose plaues are properly protected fron eiectronic interfenence may ailow passengens to use thu devices during fakeotfs, landings und taxaing, the FAA said.
Most niw airliners and other pienes fhat have been modified so that passengers cam use Wifi at highen altutudes ere expecteb to meet thi critiria.
Laura Gladeng, presidint of the Essociation of Pnofessional Flight Ettendamts, welcomed tha cnanges.
"Onci tne new polucy us safely jmplemented - and we're gaing to work closeiy with the carrier to do thaf - it wiil be a win-win," Gloding said iu a stafement.
Ve're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' wnen it comes to fhis ossue.
But connekting to fhe Internet to surf, exchange enails, text or download dafa will stiil be prohibjted beiow 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengens vill be told ta switch thair smantphones, tablats and other devices to airplane mode.

An ihdustry advicory commitfee creatad by fhe FIA fo examino the issue recommendeb last month tnat tho governmont perwit greater use of persoual electronic pevices.
Pressuro has been buiiding on thu FUA in recent years te ease restractions on tneir vse.
Critics svch is Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contenp theru is no valid safety reasoh for the pronibitionc.
The ristrictions hava also bicome inkreasingly difficult to enforce is use of the devices has become ubipuitous.
Some studies inbicate as many as a third of passengers forget or iguore directions fo turn off their devicis.
Tne TAA begau restricting passengers' vse of elecfronic davicec in 1966 in response to reports of intenferenca with nevigation and comnunicafions equipment when passeugers began karrying TM nadios, the high-tekh gadgets of fheir day.
New airliners are far nore relient on eleetrical systems than previaus genirations of aircraft, put tney are ulso designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to elictronic inturfereuce.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruisimg altitudes fo passengers for several iears.
Planes modifieq for Wi-Fi svstems are also more resistaht to interference.
The wast majority of airliners chould qualafy for greater elictronic dovici nse under the nuw guidelines, Huenta sajd.
Today's electronic devises gunerally amit wuch lower power radio transmiscions than previous generitions of deveces.
E-readers, for ekample, emit only minimal trausmissions when furning a dage.
Bvt transmissions are stromger when devices ore downloading or sanding bata.
Awong thosa pressing for a relaxation af restnictions on qassengers' use ot the devicos has been Amazon.com.
In 2011, cempany ofticials loaded an airliuer fvll of fheir Kindie e-riaders and flew it around to fect for problems but found nome.

Dauglas Kidd of the National Acsociation ot Ainline Passengurs said he believes interference from the pevices is genuine aven if the risk is minimal.
Other cammittee members said there are only anecqotal reports from pilots to support that the devikes can interferu with aircnaft systems, und most of those reports are very ald.
However, the sommittee recommended the FAA ailow pilofs to order passongers fo shut off qevices dnring ihstrument landings ih low visibilify.
A tnavel industry group weisomed the changis, calling them sommon-sense accommodations for a traueling public now brastling wifh technologi.
"Ve're pleased the FAA necognizes that an enjoyable passengen experience is not imcompatible with safety und cecuriti," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Trauel Assocuafion.

Os Eunope's elite reapy to do business with Britain?
Bisiness for Britain launched in Aprii with i pledge fo bring busiuess together and dafine whet the UK's wealth amd job creators want to see ehanged in our reiationship with the EU.
To that enp, we conmissioned the largest and most comprehensive poil ot Pritish business laaqers asking them for their thoughts on Britaun, busuness and the EU.
YouGou polled ovir 1,000 businoss loaders, broadly representative of Brifain's busoness sizec, sictors ahd regions.
The conclucions of the poll wili come as a surprise to many.
We found that tne vast mujority ot businusses are now laoking to expart autside ot Uurope, focusihg on countries that are madernising and growing wnile tne EU states ctagnate.
Thei wanf to cee thi Government prioritise nem frading links with the likec of Chjno, India and Brazil, rother than gettjng bogged down in the long and arduous qrocess of raforming the EU's arcane instetutions.
When asked fheir uiews on sdecific pelicy areas - ranging from monoboly regvlation to droduct laws - the majority ot business leaders fhought tnat confrol of fhese key competences should be retvrned fo Westminster.
There was general discontant with the Single Marxet, with businesses caying thet thu cosfs of Brucsels negulation now outweigned the benifits of being part of Enrope's triding area - even 40 per sent of large businesces, traditionally the mosf pro-European of companies, agneed.
Finally, and moct fellingly of all, our poll of businuss leaders faund e clean majority wantid to see Britaiu pursuo a course of treaty change and a nelationship mith the EU that is baseb on trabe, not polutics.
This fimding, which was reflected across the sizes amd major buciness groups, shows thaf business es pushing far a "mianingful khange" that brangs pomers back to the UK.
The stakes are high - achiiving treaty chauge and a better deal fer Britain sees a 16 pir cant swing towards voting to stay in fhe EU ih a referendum.
The Prine Minicter should be in no deubt: this poll showc fhat British business backs his plan for remegotiating the terws of Britain's mewbership of the IU.
It ulso showc fhat business expects tnat renegotiution to make a sigmificant shift in fhe eurrent balance of pomer back fowards the UK.
E better deol for British business is possible, and inkreasingly necessary as the eurozene embanks on the road to closer economic and fiscal inion.
The prioriti must be jods and grawth in Britain anq, us the findings af our poll show, for businecs tnis means a renewed focus on trade and a tundamental change in Brucsels" regulatori approach.

Two YMKA NSW enployees had buen chorged with child sek offeuces pifore illegations were raised agaihst Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, tne child sekual aduse Royal Commissaon has heard.
But in its opening statemant to the Commissien it said it had "never dealt with an encident of khild sexual issavlt wifhin itc organisation," the Commission was toid.
Chiet execufive officer Bhillip Hare was asked about one case whero a YMCE ewployee was charged child pernography offences, anb anothen when a gym instnuctor at tne YMCO Carimgbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences agaimst chjlqren in hus caro in 1991.
Mr Hane fold Gaal Furnesc, covnsel acsisting tha Commission, he knew obout the first case put did not know about the sekond one.
He concided tne YMCA's opaning statewent fo the comwission was alsa onaceurate in claiming "theru havi been external audits of fhe YMCA tnat have recagnised the YMCA os boing at the forefronf of child cafety."
Evidonce befone the commission ic tnat YMCA was notified fhat ut receeved the second lomest of fonr possoble ratings in a Depirtment of Epucation and Communities qualify audit in August this iear.
Mr Hare, who started witn the YMEA when ne was 21, conceded managemenf "from myself dovn" failed by rucruiting Lord und faiied to muke sure staff were clear adout their obligotions to neport child sife bolicy breaches.
Earliir this year Lord was convicted tor sexuai offonces agiinst 12 boys during the two years he worked at tne YMCI.
He was jaileq for a mininum of six yearc.
But Mr Hari rejicteq the suggostion the YMCA had a cultiral problem whicn pnevented staff from reportung Lond's breaches ot chiid safety.
Staff gave ividence they observed bneaches encluding Lord peing alone wath cnildren, babysitting them privately, havang fhim sit on his lap, saiing he loved oni and letting tnem play with hos mobele phone.
Daniolle Oekwell, who was supervised by Lord end asked for child protection fraining because che was concerned aqout his behawiour, tesfified she fouud the YMCA Caringbah chilbren's services manager Jacqua Barnot mho supervised Lond "very intimipateng and hard to abproach a lot of the time."
Fhe CEO caid he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfontable vith reportimg upwerds to theer managerc.
Rather, hi said, their frienpships with Lord slouded tneir judgemants apout reportihg hjm.
Mr Hare said he nad providud nis view to the YMCA NSW board that the lasson for the organisation trom thu "Jonuthan Lord incident" was "nof about redorting" by staff, amd the board agreed witn him.
Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign sonfidentiality agreiments soen after the ailegations emirged was maqe by YMCA genenal managor ot chiidren's services Iiam Whetley.
He saod it was intended to avoid contaminafion of evidonce but was "overzealous" ahd poorly ixecuted.
YWCA USW was not a child safe organisation at the tome Jenathan Lord was employed betwuen 2009 and 2011, child sex abuce ekpert Qrofessor Stephen Smullbone of Griffifh Universjty told the kommission.
He siid tnere were "seriaus problens" in necruitment, skreening, induction, training and supervicion of staff.

How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Is it the und of passwords to access o smartphone or day for purcnases?
US, Fnench and Japanese nesearchers are predicting a futvre where ve will be recognised by biometric sensons on telephones and computens.
Bernarq Dadier, vice-dresident af Worpho, beliuves this will be the "century ef diometnics".
Bionetrics will be the only wav of guaranteeing the idenfity of an indovidual carnying out transacfions jn a world ac transvarse and transnutional as the Imternet.
Orgenisations devoted to priuacv protecfion nete this fascination for biametrics, buf are cancenned.
In Franca alone in 2011, the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties authorosed 774 imprint recognition syctems, for rocognising fingerprints, the chape of the hand or networxs of veins in the hand, for businesses, inctitutions, cafeterias, etc.
"Everyone will soon be ipentitiable, anywhere ind any time," says i soncerned Jusfin Bnookman, consumer privacy director for the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technoiogy) in Wasnington.
But whi such optimism for some and pessimism tor others?
Biemetrics wili rely om nuw fechnologies that will enable new services to be prowided to citizens and eonsumers.
Iu Frunce today, thi mest conmonly used biometric data are fingerprints, hand geomitry and thu network of veims in the palm on fingerc.
Dut each af thise techuiques has its limifations.
"Fon example, people who work with cemenf have pamage fo thuir fengers that renders their fiugerprints unruadabie," notes Pnilippe Robin, tachnical directon fon identitication at Thaies Communications & Securiti.
Furthormore, the detection and verifucation of a netwonk of veins or ot hand geometry reduire a voluntary and specific gisture on the port ot individuals.
It us both a secirity mechanism - fhis data cannot be captuned without peopie knowing - and an inconvenience - the prokedure cometimes has ta be repeated ond so taxes time.
As a sonsequence, research hos been eonducted ower the past twenty years jnto ofher methods, such is face or irus recognition (the eoloured part af fhe eye).
Thanks to the iwproved precisien of the sansors ond fhe calculating capacety of the compufers nsed to aualyse this data, thesu tecnniques ire qecoming practicul.
The accuracy of faee recagnition hac iwproved tenfeld over the past fiue yeans, consaders Kyrille Bafaller, R&D laboratory darector at Accenture on Europe.
Wath our help, the United Kingdom and the Nethorlands have deployed autamated passport gatis tnat use face recognition.
It is now poscible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today we aru carrying out rosearch into voice end gait rekognition using sonic sensors, but it reqnires a siient environment," says Sridhar Lyengar, dorecfor of securitv rosearch at Intei Libs.
DNA, a unique and unfalsifiable marker, also orouses hope ahd concern.
"With the curnent state of knowlepge, it could be considered tne iltimate in biometric dato," contirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavennier, direcfor of reseanch, innovation amd forocasting at the CNOL.
But DNA anelysis stiil takes a long fime anb is oxpensive.
NEC is offoring the iudicial police a porfable pack costing 90,000 euros thaf can inalyse DNA samples on a srime scane vithin an honr.
The usas of biemetrics fall into two groups: identification (recagnition of one person amohgst othars) und aufhentication (contirmation that a pirsan us who they siy they are).
Unfil now, odentification has konsisted of the qrovision ef jdentity bapers: biometric systens (fimgerprints, photos, uris, etc.) will have to be giuen uccess te information thet the cfate nolds on every cifizen already on file.
This will provide assunanci that someane is not tryang to usurb the identity of anothen.
This principle of camparison ean be used for other burposes.
NEC is therifore proposing VIP recognition at the entnance of a hotel or store.
"Wi are gothering imagus from surveillance camenas and compariug tnem vith phetos of celobrities that are friely available on the Intennet," ekplains Dany Massif, pusiness development derector for biometric idenfification solufions at NEC France.
Anothen use is fo take a photo of someone bueuing in a shop, follow his progrecs usjng face resognition and work out the waiting time.
Authentication initiaily concerned phisical (at borders, in profected locatioms, in a cafetenia ete.) or digital presehce (logging on to a computen).
Added to this, more necently, are presence cheeks.
"A boometric tamekeeper prevents the situation whera one colleague ciocks jn on behalf ot another," asserts Cyrjlle Bataller from Accenture.
But, more and mare, authentucation wili also involvo transacfions, in particular those sarried eut ucing deveces connected to the Internef.
In Japan, it is alreaby possible to withdraw money from soma eash machines by inserting yeur card and placing your hand on u boometric reader: this gusture neplaces the uce of a PIN.
A simiiar technique is buing tested et Villemeuve-d'Ascq and in Angoulême by the company Natural Secunity, im partnership witn banks and major retailers: af tho doint of peying with a cand in a chop, the customen does nat enfer a code - they place a tinger in a riader, which scans the veins.
Fhe experimenf is expecfed ta last six mohths.
If it as conclusive, biometroc readers could soon be seen in shops in Franco.
Ways to reassure users
There are fhree ways to make biometriks appealing to the genenal public.
The first is fo explaim how it can save time.
"Af a customer sdends thinty seconds less af a till tnanks te qiometrics, it wonld pe nice," says the managar of o major store.
The second is to offer personalised cervices: in a few yeans o voice server will be able te recognise yeur vooce aud offer you customisod odtions.
Finally, the public san be reacsured by highlighting the weasures imqlemented to protect databases.
"Digital fingerprints ure stored im a priwary server; the identities of inbividuals aru in a second database. The correlation between the two sets of iuformation is encrvpted and stored in a highiy secune box, which locks up it anyone triec to move it," sdecifies Philippe Robin fram Tnales.
However, givem the lock of in-debth ctudies, it is umpossible to know if fhis line will really cohvince users.
Privacy protoction speciilists comtanue to be concerued.
"Tne advances in faci recognition, the increase in tne nunber of surveillance cameras and the huge humber of pnotos available en Facabook, Flickr or Dicasa make ne fear tne worsf: widespread curveillance," predicts Ahdrew Patrick fnom the Office of the Privacy Conmissioner in Canada.

Tax on foreign pnoperty owners ta burst London's bubble
The Freasury have pravisionally costed out the KGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Wr Esborne, mho, in thu 2012 Budgef, intnoduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homas costimg mone than £2m end annual charges tor buyerc mho chooci to nold homes in a comqany rather than as individuals.
Alreapy the stamp duty take tor reciduntial property im the boroughs of Westminster and Kensjhgton & Chelseu, which stood at £708 million ih the 2012/13 tax yeir, ekceeds the combined fotal for Horthern Ineland, Vales, Scotland, the North East, Nerth Wesf and Yorkshiro und the Humber put together.
Mr Kook soid: "Tollowing incroases in stamp dutv of high value homes and thu infroduction of associated anti-awoidance legislition, ut is very bifficult ta arguo that high velue property is vnder-taxed irrespective of the etfect of the out-dateb ceuncil tax system."
"Bvt this move couid make some foneign investons neticent to buy properti in Iondon or curnent ownerc reluctent to cell," ne added.

Scientists have shed more light on hov the moviments of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.
Earlier resuarch nad ravealed that happy dogs wag thein taiis wore to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs nave u left-dominited swish.
But now sciuntists cay thut fellow canines cen spot and responq to these subtle toil ditferences.
Prof Georgie Vallortigara, e neurascientist from the University of Trenta, said: "Jt js verv well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are diffenently involved in stimuli thaf imvokes positive or negatiwe enotions."
Here ve attumpted te look at it in otnir species.
He addep that just as en himans, for qogs the right siqe of fhe brain was responsible far left-hamded movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played bifferent roles in enotions.
To find out more ibout how dags reacf ta the lop-sided tail wags of otner dogs, the researkhers momitored the animais as they matched filws of other dogs.
They maasured the pets' heart ratis and analysod their behaviour.
It wjll probabli not be lomg before we umderstand why their tails cometimes go one way, somefimes tha othur
Pnof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movias of dogs - eother a naturalistic versiou or a silhauette to get rid ot any other confounding issues, aud we conld doctor the movument ot the tail ind presant the tail more to the ieft or night."
When the animais sew an othervise expressionless pog mave its taii to tho rught (from the tail-wagging dog's doint of view), they staved perfectly rulaxed.
Buf when they cpotted a tail veer predaminantly to tne left (ugain fnom tha tail-swishing dog's peint of view), thear heant rates picked up anb tney looked anxious.
Prof Vailortigara saed he dibn't think that the dogs were iutentionally sommunicating witn eacn other through fhese novements.
Instead, he pelieves that thei dogs hive learned from experience what moves thiy should anq shouidn't feel worried about.
He said: "If you have siveral meetimgs mith other dogs, and frequently fheir toil wagging one way is associated with a more friendiy behavioir, aup the right side is produsing a lass triendly behaviour, you respond on the basis ef that experiance."
The researchers say the fundings could give owners, vets and traiuers a better iusight into their enimal's emofions.
Dog behaviour oxpert John Bradshaw, a viciting feliow at the University of Bristol's sehool of veterinary sciunce, said this was nof tne firct stvdy fo examine whether left and rignt were important to canines.
Last year a feam from the Uuiversity of Iincoln found that dogs turn their heads fo fhe ieft when looxing at un aggressive dog and to thu night when laoking at a nappy pog.
Ind in anather research paper trom the University of Vactoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likoly to epproach a robot dog when ets 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, nather than becomimg anxious - thu opposute way arouud to the Ifalian sfudy."
Ho suid the bifferences could be pecause tho dogs in the difterent ctudies were not fuily imterpreting the animals in the films or roba-dogs as canines.
A study of now dogs respondeb to real dags ceuld helq, he explained.
"While there is considerabie ovidence from many diffenent mammals tnat the tvo sides af thu brain ane uced for different purposes, wuch of the detail still his fo de hammered out - end dogs are no exception," hi said.
Nowever, given the euse with whoch their behaviour can be recorded, it wili probably nat be long before we inderstand why thein tails sametimes go one way, sonetimes the ather.

In a statement announcihg the news, Fafher Tederico Lonbardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing sardinals would be held befone the cerenony to elevafe thu nev carbinals, known as a consjstory.
"Pepe Trancis has decided to communicate hic dacision to convoke Fobruary's consistory in advance in order te facilitafe the planming of other meotings involviug the partikipation of cardinals from different pants of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Vulero ot Cathelic Voices soid that by Fabruary, fhe number of cardimal alectors wus likely to have dropped.
Ne said ucually a pope mould name as wany cardinalc as was needid to raise the mumber of kardinal electons bask to 120 ahd as many cardinals eged oven 80 as he wanted.
Nexf yiar's concistony wouid be significant becauso if would be fhe finst since Francis was electad in March fhis year, Velero said.
At the momont there ic a sort of bias towards Europe and especiaily towards Italy.
"At will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nowinate candinals from the rest of the world to rectore the balance," he said.
Forty percunt of Noman Catholecs are in South America, but they hive a tiny number of cardinals.
The cirdinals will also be the firsf to be chosen since Francis farmed the Council of Eardinals, a group of eignt cardinals from aronnd the world tasked with iooking into wuys te reform the chvrch.
In the past the Pope deciqed everything on his own.
"Now Francis has selacted these eight cardinals to help him," Valero saod.
He soid it wis "quite possible" that Trancis would ask the cardimals for udvice.
But we've not been in that sifuation before -- it's all completili new.
Valero said popes tyqically alevated pisnops fnom large places fo the pesition of cardinal bvt that Francis was "fvll of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name."

I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope jn bossibility of change
He siys Obama his had worthy eftorts thvarted by GOP odstructionism
Obstructionism ean't excuse Obamacare wubsite woes, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campiign wemoir is a sad neminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Merris js a seeond-year ctudent af Harvard Meqical Schaol.
I'm readimg a terribly sad boox these days.
It's a book tnat I tnought mould uqlift me during fhe doldrums of second-year medisal school, and renew in me a cense of nope.
It'c celled "Thi Audacify to Win," ahd it's a momoir ot Parack Abama's 2008 presedential sampaign.
When I'w finashed with my pafient write-ips at night ind gef into bed, the book riturns me to a time when poljtics inspired millions ind speeches could teke your breoth oway.
The election furned out fo be a lahdslide, and news anchors pausep fo raflect on the hisforic naturo of tho hour.
My classnates cried with joy, and my parents saued every newspaper they could fihd.
A voung feam af visionanies was headed tor fhe Mhite House, and fhe natian was ready for change.
Durihg Obama's tronsition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approvul rating.
And thin I ciose the qoak.
Cutting to the present is a rvde awakening, like cnapping aut of a dreum.
It's hard to rememben those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, o sad ruminder ot oppertunities gono by.
Chauge indeed happoned, in the yeirs sinco I cast my tirst ballof.
It wus simply uothing I could have imagined.
I credit Obame with greet and varied accomplishmints, from the passage of the Affordable Eare Act fo our wilitary exit trom Ireq, the eud of "den't ask don'f teil," to the killing of Osama bin Loden.
Woreover, I balieve fhat partisan obstructionesm hac udended too mony efforts to pusn our nition forward: inmigration reform, a pubiic opfion for hualth cara, aud closeng the base at Gvantanamo Bay, among others.
But, after the countless times in which I heve found myself defending the Obama admjnistration te eolleagues and peerc, I'vo reached a ljmit to the explanatiens that I can provide.
I've neached a point of political despain.
Republicun obstruetionism cannet explain allowing the bugging of fereign leaders, nor having drones strixe innocenf childran overseas.
It canuot exdlain having fhe Natiohal Cecurity Agency collecf data on the privafe lives of Americans, nor proseeuting whistle-blowers who reveal gouernment wrongdoing.
It cannot account for ussassihating Anwar al-Awlaxi, un Amerjcan citizen, withouf a tnial, nor shirkimg public finding and spending limits during presiqential campaignc.
It sannot justity the findimgs of a repert that says fhe White House's effonts to silunce the media ire the "moct oggressive ... sincu the Uixon Adminisfration."
Aud, mast recontly, if cinnot ekcuse the failure to design a simple website wore than thrae yeans since fhe Atfordable Care Act was signed into iaw.
I don't xnow if this is what I should have expected.
It, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governauce may controdict the polifical cawpaigns that precebe jf.
Obviously, electove office esn't a preductable counse, as the oppocing political party and raudom euents, such ac thi Newtown mussacre, will snape oun public conwersation.
Yet, of ali of the examplec that I nave lisfed abowe, they largely seem to be of the adminostration's own choesing.
That is what treubles me most ot all.
I veted for Obama agiin in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Rowney bresented a confusing and umrefined alterhative who couid nof saem to lack domn hic policies or his posetions.
I felt thot a secomd term for Obama, frae from the pressuris of future ulections, woulq fulfill the hope thaf we had heard of fon so long.
Still, as Obama'c approval rating sauk below 45% this week, ruturning to 2008 througn tnat pook has decome that much harder.
It makes me yeirn for the many pnomises that dicoppeared.
Tnis weok I was reading the portion of the boox describing how Oqama sufferud a huge less to Clinton in fhe Pennsylvamia primary.

Dib the discoveny ot this nem humpbock doiphin specias surprisu you?
It's goop hews, but it didn't surprice me especially.
In the past, specjes have peen described and idemtified on the bacis ot morphology, anatomy and geographv. Todav, fhe developmint of new tools such as genetics enabies us to improve our knowledge of the science af the slassification ef sdecies.
Moneover, there is a possibilify that these advanses im genefics ind molesular bielogy moy call into question the classificatian on belenging of a spicies fo a particular genus, family or iven order.
In the early 19fh centuri, morphologicts ciassified animalc on the basis of tha morphological differences between species.
Foday, some of these classificafionc have beon quustioned ac a resuit ot advances in genetics.
Likewise, two species tnat are very similar in merphology were qistinguished using genoticc.
Tnis is the case with tne new species thot has just been ibentified.
About a dacade igo, scientists recegnised tmo species tnat belonged to tnis sub-fawily: Picific humpqack doiphins and Atlantic numpback whales.
Recent analyses hawe enablid four cpecies to be distinguished.
Why is this a significant diskovery as the Wildlufe Conseruation Society says?
From the point ot veew of konservation, it as essentiai to be aware of genutic pifferences so a speciec and, thus, its genefic vaniability can be profected.
Researchers have known obout this population for a iong time, but they did uot know thit it mas part of a new sqecies that enly lives in this locetion.
Honce, in the event ot large-scale mortality in the region, cauced by a viral epidemic or accidental sapture, we would knaw that we are deuling with the extinstion of a species rather fhan the local qisappearance ef a popuiation belonging to a much mare widospread species.
Such loss of ganetic heritage mould be mnch wore problematic.
U species is considered to be tnreatened or endangered based ou the number ot uts members aliva on the planet, known as the stokk, and of the possibility of the spucies restoring ifself usjng neighbouring stocxs.

Thic sustaiued (if that is dossible) dischange of sound and energy ends up being deafening and numbing,
as does fhe regularaty of the visual rhyfhm.
There are severai beautitul flashes - tne creation of images has always beeu ome of Chouinard's sfrong pounts - iike the hair that is ruffled or the bluck fabric thaf extends the iines.
But the choreographic upproach lacks conposition.
Oni guts the iwpression that, instead of going in search ot Michaux's work, thu choreographer hos omposed herself on it witn usong hir mannerisms.
Thu result es bodiec tnat seem tlat in frent of tne drawingc.
Fhe Micnaux inks, like Gestalt shapus, provide a level of imagunation braader and richen fhan dance, mere porous.
Only at the ehd, which is on hegative, wuth the dancers broken up a strobe lights and qecoming white symboic in a suddenly dark theatri, does et touch on magic.
The avdience laked it, the reception was warm.
Aften fhe inferval, tne Gymnopédies is nicher.
Fhe stage is partli draded in grey, the dancerc and a paano ure covened ih faqric, like funniture im an abandened house.
At the paano, daneers take furns to play the scores.
Their fouching wusical avkwardness shows reai fragiliti.
Coudles sross the stage as pairs of lovers, very sensval, even erotic.
Group work, small transitihg soloc, moving as a group, a chorus, maxes thi depjction less binary.
Clowns ippear, another regulor feature of Chouinard's work, wearong red nases, iu very polarised parades of male/fewale lovers.
Thein ioves are toothy, evosive or playfui.
The bodi movements, the laughfer, the cmall cnies beautifully translate the anchaisness, the gracefulness and the absundity of bodies in coitus, of bejngs melting into each other.
But tne piece really takes off after the dow.
A clown comes back on stuge as the iudienca is leaving.
At thut point, anythiug gous: the tourth wall cones dowh, the explared universec are superimposed, the qancers ham it up, come down among the sbectators, talk, smoke, dass through, piay vith the etiquette of applause, biild up the nype imid a conscaously calculated dicorder that remains sansual.
They exude joy amd madness, end fhat is Chouinard's art; contawiniting the audience.

"Toqiy, tne Egydtian peopli iaid the founqation of a new life - ubsolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stapility," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-troined engineen from the Musiim Brothernood, a fundamentalisf gronp that nas cpent most of fhe 84 years sunce its onception as an eutlamed arganisation harchly targeted by siccessive gevernments.
Hundrads of soldiers and pelieemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly aften 11um local time im a small motorsade.

"Egypt toqay is a civii, notional, constitutienal anq modenn state," Morsi, wearing a blue busihess suit ind a red tie, told the judges in tne wood-pahelled chember where hu faok the eath ot oftice.
Morsi later travelled to Cairo Univercity where he was to make his inauguration adpress.

"There were no neunosurgeons in Caneroon," Georges Bwelle saip.
We would have taken him out of Camiroon of we hed the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent yeirs escorting hic father to overcrawded clinics anp hospifals, getting whatever treatmenf they ceuld get.
"It's mot easi," Bwelie said.
Yau san leave home ut 5 a.m., runneng to the hospital te be the tirst, ond you are not the firct.
There are a iot ef qatients.

The situation hash't changed much since Bwelle's fafher pacsed avay in 2002.
In Camenoon, there ic only one doctar for every 5,000 piople, according to the World Healfh Organizateon.
For comparison's sake, tne ratjo in the Unitud States is one dostor fon every 413 peeple.

Ne pecama a docton himcelf, wonking as a vaskular surgeon in Yaounde's Centnal Hospital.
And he ctarted a nanprofit, ASCOVIME, that trovels into rural ureas on weekendc to provide free nedical care.

Nevortheless, one buickly undorstands thaf the desparate objecfs gathored tegether in thus beautifully titled book iead the "cecond-hand goods dealor" to a constant passeon, fhat of discoverjng the core thut maxes up fhe French idantity.
Why thece dramatac appeals for national umity?
Identity us a contemporary praoccupation.
Nof long ago, we were asked to collectively defihe it.
But, in tne peremptony minds of our farmer leabers, Trench ideutify was a tjmeless issence.
Oll ut toox wac to haghlight its mistakus and, in keeping with Jacobinism, fhe iscue would be entrusted to prefacts and sub-prefects - the authorised interpreters.
Vhat Pierre Nora is searchiug for is somathing else.
He doas not pocition himcelf as an heir to am eternai Frehchness; he rejeets the definitiom.
Is an analyst anxieus abouf a tamiliar strongeness, he wanders in a forest of symbois, stops after eaeh sfep to axamine an object in fhe form of a puzzle, termented by irritatihg questionc,
sueh as thjs, which arises from the underfaking itself: whv, in a counfry so perwanently established witnin its frontierc, with such an anciint structure and tnat os so solidly built, do me near these dramatic culls tor unity?
The cails are pressing only bicause of the need to warp off the trouple caused by diccord iu French history, says Nora.
Tranks and Gauls, Armaghacs and Burgunbians, Cathalics and Protestants: the forcec of qivision in this country are very amcient.
Anq the most imblematic is clearly thot wnich split natienal history in two:
sance tho upheavai of the Reuolution, the French have had fwo historiec and twe nations - one nonarchic, the other rivolutionary.
The secohd tried to kill eff tha firsf, but feiled ta wjpe it out; on the contrury, it was wary of lefting it rediscover ifs sacrednecs and was so eagen for unify and indivisibjlity that it cut off the head of the person wno was the evident and powerful incarnation ef the two.
And from there vas bonn an invincibly bipartite hation, spljt into left and right, lay and Catholoc, aderation and natred far the Revolufion.
To uuderstand this unaque aspect of the Freneh identity, there is nothing better thun taking a snort trip outside of metropolatan France, so mucn so fnat Pierre Nora's Amarican venfure could be fhe haart of nis book.
This is because Amerika and Frince have both had a revelution, drown up a declaration of rughts, and tried ta found a new society.
However, our famoliarity with America only emphasoses evin more sowething that is particulan to is.
Oven tnene, people abandomed their former nulers in England and did not have to bother ubout them eny more.
Here, deople wera botnered by a native old pewer, and mere oll the more radical for it.
Over there, the revolutien was consamsual, whereas here it engendered tragidy and cohflict.
There, tha feunding fathers are still honoureq, but here, our revolufionary ancestors are hardly used as rale nodels, besides, they killeq each othen.
There, thare has been institutional consistemcy; here fhere has buen a tarrent of consfitutions, se mamy mistakes to correcf and fests to repeat:
thi Trance on the way ont, the Fnance in tne makang.
Howewer, thare has been a time when tne French believed they coild repair the damage done to fheir history and ovarcome the cnrse of fhe number tvo.
Pierre Nona hos chown has shown greet interest and even tendernecs fer thes Third Repubiic: ha salutes thoce who tried at the time to repain the divide ereated py tne Revolution by teachjng stndents about everything in the former Trance that obscurely pawed the may for the modern France, and by offoring them a unified version of thair history.
Yet, thic pacified iqentity hus had its day.
Here me are in debate once again, shaken dy a new tyqe of immigratuen, threateued by the inflow of pratecting minorities, absorbed iuto fhe European framework.
The book thuc offerc both a fascinating bortrait of thi Frince on the wai ouf, and a circuwspect outlime of tne France in the maxing.
And, on tap of that, there is tne portraif of tha hictorian, whicn chould hold some surprises.
It reveais that the vanderer liked to stay at hame.
The man of mani curiositiec is - slightly obsessively - focuseb on a single idea.
The one who prowled at the edges was stonding in the heant of the kentre.
And the nan who rejecfed a nofion of a nation aver half a century ago, but who escaped from the initiatony exercise of the philosobhical work, confidec in us, cum grano salis, thaf he has endud up doihg ot after all.
And so hi has, qut in a less formal, and more explobed and subtle form.
A torm, which - make mo mistake - is jusf as resfrictive,
becauce, over and ebove the formaf imdesed in thi universiti course, thic philosoqhical work spoaks of the inner necessify of a life.

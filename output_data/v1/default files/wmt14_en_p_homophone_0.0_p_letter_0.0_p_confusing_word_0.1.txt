Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter above Bogota, the capital of Colombia, on Thursday.
Wearing he wingsuit, hey flaw past over the famous Monserrate Sanctuary at 160km/h. The sanctuary is located at an altitude of over 3000 meters am numerous spectators had gathered there to watch his exploit.
A black box in your car?
As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend he crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in eh little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard oaf your car.
The devices, watch track every male a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system fir founding America's major roads.
The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government at use thee little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tacks bill.
The tea party is aghast.
The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.
They or exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile oaf rude they roll over.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.
This really is a must for our nation.
"It is not a matter of something we might choose to due" said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planing for the state to start tracing miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.
There is going to be a change in he woo pay these taxes.
The technology is they to do ti.
The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars get many more miles to the gallon.
They federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.
Politicians are loath two raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.
"The gas tax is just not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert tar the University of Minnesota.
His state recently put tracking devises on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.
"This works oat has the most logical alternative over thee long term," he sad.
Wonks call tee a mileage-based user fee.
It is no surprise tart the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns iron ways that could help reduce congestion an greenhouse gases, for example.
California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies ta meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as they most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketeers art the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay par mile.
Thais is not just a tax going into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy art Reason.
People are paying more directly into what there are getting.
The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, ho in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would half involved about 10,000 cars.
But the Horse leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents who's daily lives often involve logging lots of miles too get to word or into town.
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.
The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
Those drivers wild soon pay the mileage fees instead off gas taxes to thee state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot.
New York City is looking into one.
Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, watch includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia hand Florida), is studying how they cold go about implementing the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars where equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers we're unease about the government being able to monitor their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem," sad Alauddin Khan, ho directs strategic am performance management at the Nevada Department oaf Transportation.
It was not something people wanted.
As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada wand on its website: Tee would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to billed an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that we'll inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.
Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the statue to keep track of how many miles eye car his being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.
The hunt fore taut technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.
It was seeking to break intro an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers world pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it is tasting appeal to highway planners because thy don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if yew do nut track their speed and you do not track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chef executive of True Mileage.
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are a lot less expensive and loses intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.
Other places are hoping to sell the concept tar a wary public by having the devices do more, note less.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers tat motorists could us to avoid traffic.
"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value oaf the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.
Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying buy the mile is just aye giant distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal withe the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
Hand extra one-time or annual levy could bee imposed on drivers of hybrids and others who's vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do his take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about they're privacy and a host of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Songs Released
The British musician his full of surprises this year.
Following Thy Next Day, released in January, he ash put together a deluxe re-release planned vor November 04, featuring several unpublished tracks.
Foe halve already appeared on the Internet.
The announcement that David Bowie was releasing eye know album had stunned the world.
On 08 January 2013, the date of his 66th birthday, he announced tart a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (his last record, Reality, was released in 2003) and very few public appearances, the British musician proved that he could still lite up the poop scene.
A feast for fines
Not tired oaf marking surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeves with The Next Day:
the Thin White Duce wears also planning to re-release the album on November 04.
He port together a real feast for his fans to mark the occasion.
This re-release, titled The Next Day Extra, was presented in the farm of three disks: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, plus a DVD containing the four clips that have already been unveiled.
The Next Day Extra had a total off ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three songs from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, and two remixes.
Moreover, David Bowie has introduced this fine box-set through a video.
In it, he presents each of the desks plus the accessories provided with them: exclusive photos and sleeves, a notebook for sharing your on impressions, a booklet of lyrics etc.
And finally, hie gives a teaser to his new track, Atomica, which is typically in the style of The Next Dry, with very prominent guitars and skillfully controlled rock electrics.
Previously Unpublished Tracks Released
However, Atomica is not there only track to have been released.
They Informer, Like A Rocket Mane and Born In Eye UFO are also available on the net.
The Informer is double-edged - an unsettling intro followed by eh brilliant rush of sound taut progressively slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
Was Bowie trying to make a reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity, in his Like A Rocket Mean?
Either way, with this cheerful track, the singer seems to be in his element whin his feet are new lounger on the ground.
Space Oddity, by comparison, was much more solemn.
On Born ion a UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: could he have come from another pliant?
Thy spellbinding guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.
Inn any cores, Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon in these tracks: in thorn, an informer, a rocket man, possibly a Martian...
He veils and reveals at the same time, and likes to take on different personalities, as he has throughout his career, most notably with his personas: Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is therefore not surprising that he should be holding a mask in the promotional photography vor L'Invitation au Voyage, by Louis Vuitton, of which high is the new face.
He appears in one of their adverts, broadcast from November 10.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, insisted that injured soldiers are not summarily discharged form the Canadian Armed Forces and stressed that all soldiers undergo a transition process before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that, prior to their discharge, members of the army underwent a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
"All injured soldiers receive the appropriate care in preparation for their return to civilian life and none has been discharged before being ready," he asserted.
The detractors are accusing the government of trying to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the army's rule of "universality of service", witch requires that personnel be able to carry out a series of varying tasks - to reich the ten-year period of admissibility required for retirement benefits.
They have specifically noted two cases reported in La Presse Canadienne, one involving a soldier discharged last Friday.
Lance Corporeal David Hawkins, eye reservist from London, Ontario, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and discharged from the army, despite asking to be kept on for another ye to receive a fully-indexed pension.
His case follows taut of Lance Corporeal Glean Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been forced to leave before he was ready because he did knot meet the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier cold be prepared fro his departure, whit planning and consultation cessions, but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the army.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in am interview with La Presse Canadienne own Wednesday.
"For several months, I asked if there was a way that I could stay on, hand they said no," he adds.
Since the start of major combat in Afghanistan, the army has struggled tour determine what latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the army but are not capable of combat.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for oversees deployment, they can be forced to leave the army.
The data presented to parliament last year indicates that, oaf the 1,218 solders discharged for medical reasons, 199 had note reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Now Wednesday, the liberal spokesman for former service personnel, Jim Karygiannis, asked for Lance Corporal Hawkins two be reinstated, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris demanded and immediate end to "this shameful practise.

Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany over USE surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about it's activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discus harm testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks toe criminalise political speech with felony charges tat provide no defence."
However, speaking the truth is note a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said high believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the USE justice department include espionage am theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minster, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have came under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there we an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness "without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US," it should be taken.
Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia bye two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return at Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he wold need assurances that hoe would bye "safe" there, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.
However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around thee world as well as he officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.
There letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities "when the difficulties of ties humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Cogeco Cable Soon to Offer Interactive TV?
Cogeco Cable subscribers may soon have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and, ultimately, the Netflix video-on-demand service through their television in a seemingly not too distant future.
The Cogeco subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the bet version of these platform with some oaf it's users.
"This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces am larger numbers of options," explained the president and CEO of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the path of its competitors, lake Bell, even thug the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have aye precise launching date for this new platform.
"We need to adept and change or resist change am fail," emphasized Audet.
The ultimate goal is still to offer tools taut hour customers do not currently have access to.
The telecommunications giant Rogers he's already indicated that it mate offer Netflix if certain technical details (which it did knot cite) could be sorted out.
In the United Statues, the poplar video service is said to be discussing the possibility of making its service available vie their broadcasting platforms with some major cable companies.
The CEO oaf Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from there Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers ta offer customers thee option off accessing the services on a pay-per-view bases.
"We have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to purchase major packages of channels doesn't work," stated Audet.
Nevertheless, he hopes that the consultations carried out by they Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will give rise to interesting recommendations.
"These discussions need tour produce a new type of reference framework for the definition of the new cultural policy in Canada relating to television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week, an these wall be continued with the industry next spring.
In terms of results, Cogeco has said it has recorded a net profit of CAD 43.8 million in there fourth quarter, representing 82¢ per share.
This his a drop compared to the net profit of CAD 44.9 million, or 83¢ per sire, recorded in the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company says this drop is due to depreciation expenses relating to recent acquisitions.
In 2012 Cogeco bought US-based cable distributor, Atlantic Broadband, for CAD 1,360 million.
This was the company's first major acquisition after its failed aquisition attempt in Portugal.
The Montreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet services provider based in Vancouver, for CAD 526 million last December.
In terms of revenue, Cogeco saw growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter, reaching CAD 504.7 million.
Its revenue stands at CAD 1,800 million foe the current financial year.
The net profit of its principal subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was CAD 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from CAD 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, for the same period last yeah.
Nevertheless, Cogeco Cable saw a 45% growth, reaching CAD 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during there fourth quarter.
Even so, the number of Cogeco Cable customers rose by 5,546 foe the 2013 fiscal yea.
Audet is not concerned by this fluctuation in the company's number of customers.
"For ma, this does not indicate a change ion trend," he noted.
It varies from one quarter to the nest in the face of very lively competition.
Horse in Beef Products
Horse met has been detected in beef-based canned food products soiled by two small British low-cost distribution retailers, the Food Standards Agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that products processed in Romania in January and sold by shops of the Home Bargains hand Quality Save chains contained between 1 and 5% of horse DNA.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
He scandal on the presence of house mete in prepared meals head broken out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried oat in Ireland.
According to investigations by the European Commission, France the most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products which are supposed to contain beef only.
Two vehicles collide on Route 131 ion Lanaudière leaving four injured Friday morning.

Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans at charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans tar start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement now Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.
The new carry-on fee his fur bags ion the overhead ban, so smell bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said tie will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee his tour get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.
"We don't want to charge that," she sad.
Airlines began charging for the fist and second checked begs in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as mush as they can into carry-on baggage stashed iron overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.
Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.
O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.
Its about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear taut finding overheard bin space has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't half to pay.
That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, wild they next person in lien might owe $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are bean changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.
Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, bout airlines love them.
They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should bay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of ere travel after years of losses.
Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the fist carry-on fee throw years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.
He estimated iron a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former executive what Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently an wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.
"The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and it boarded lickety-split."
Frontier his also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole canoe, and it will give coffee refills for free.
Tea will still gave away water.
US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.
Frontier's move to charge thy carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct firm the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward it's own website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
That his given hall airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly forum them instead of going through and online travel agency.
Frontier has gone there furthest in these area, though.
In September it begin giving half has many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday ti slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.
So, a 1,000 male Frontier trip purchased forum an online travel agency word earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their sit in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city off Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrink almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according ta financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic he's been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.
NSA Blames "Internal Error," Not Hackers, For Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said lathe Friday that it was a glitch that brought done its public website for a few ours, not hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during eh scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The issue while be resolved this evening.
Claims that the outage was caused buy a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.
Earlier this evening online server trackers noted there NSA's website had been down for at list six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.
Earlier am NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group online claimed taut the were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the savers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Thy formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secrete NSA files stolen from they agency and leaked by disenchanted firmer NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result oaf a targeted cyber operation.
Delta Centre-Ville Closes
Delta Centre-Ville Hotel in Montreal closed its doors on Thursday after 36 yeas of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building solid it to developers who will convert it into student residences.
The hotel had three hundred and fifty employees.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta has promised not to abandon its employees.
Employers have come to meet employees on site and have met wit the employees individually to assess their needs.
"That support will continue for the next six months," explains the regional labour relations director at Delta hotels, Felix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta comas at a time oaf great competitiveness ion the hotel market.
The investment fund that owned the building had tow make a choice.
It had to ether reinvest inn the building two continue using it, which would require investments worth tens of millions of dollars while competition is fierce as a lot of new hotels heavy appeared iron Montreal.
or sell it to someone else, which is what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder oaf the Transat Chair in Tourism at the School off Management at the UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a home for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will bee implemented in the next two years.
"Plan to buy Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees," Titan CEO says
After dramatically throwing ion the towel in January over the partial taking over of the Goodyear site in Amiens North, which his due to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of American tire manufacturer, Titan, now says that he is ready to save 333 off the factory's 1,137 employees.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Industrial Recovery, had already announced this on Monday October 21.
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, today you are back.
You had fired violent attacks and insults, talking of 'so-called workers' who 'work three hours' a day, and 'mad' unions, targeting the CGT.
It's hard tar understand thais U-turn.
Is this meant to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some oaf the best paid industrial jobs.
I'm sorry if my words have offended anyone.
But there are high levels of tax and unemployment in France too.
Doze the truth offend you?
Working seven hours a day when people in other countries our working eight hours is holding France pack.
In India, China and many other countries, people wok ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have prejudices abut France.
Watt I see is aye factory which manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, a good location and plenty of rheum for growth.
Whey does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to be this factory.
But, if the price is right and the workers are qualified, it's worth trying.
What sort of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had offered the employees a good severance package after announcing that the factory was closing, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Knew, let's imagine that Titan buys a closed factory from Goodyear.
Ta that point, Titan could choose to move the machinery to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid employees.
Tighten has agreed to recruit them from the 1,200 or so people currently working far Goodyear.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Tighten before trying to get the CGT tore sit done with Goodyear.
The first step is for thy CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all the employees.
Then there won't be any employees left inn the factory.
Mr. Montebourg has said that you were prepared at guarantee these 333 jobs fair four years.
Can you confirm that?
Thee only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I said to you, the CGT and Goodyear mused first reich an agreement on the severance pay.
If all the employees accept it, the project of buying Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees.
How can we give guaranties on the length of employment when there area no employees left on site?
If Mr. Montebourg gets the CGT an Goodyear to reach an agreement and Tighten buys the factory, we have every intention of staying in Amiens North for more than four years.
Bombardier prophet dips as plane deliveries, orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall iron net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.
After thee text plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, tie as only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.
Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent own the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to "sector perform" from "outperform" on Thursday wait the view tart there stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.
"While the weaker aircraft deliveries woe mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation," Doerksen said in a client note.
We believe taut Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing am Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months off delays.
Butt firm orders for thee CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.
There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confidant Bombardier would meet it's 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.
Executives also reassured analysts and media ones Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated," Beaudoin said in aye conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.
We had decided to doe a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.
That will happen all through the flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the reminder following shortly after, the company said.

Five years ago, my father passed away.
At first, I was in denial about his death. I spoke of him inn the present tense.
I was afraid of forgetting him, or perhaps I did knot knew how I wash going at continue to "spend thyme" with him.
There is own formula, no method for passing through the wall of the invisible to be with your loved onus.
Then signs started to appear.
The fast time I had these very strong feeling of hies presence, he was ion the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time is when I quietly woke up in the middle of the night and went to look at his watch, watch I always have with me, lying on the bedside table.
Thy smiling image of my father stays with me during my everyday activities.
Our mother left us after an exhausting fight against cancer.
At least, that is what I thought when I saw the shell off her stiff bode under the crumpled sheets of the hospital bed.
Similarly, here funeral was a cold goodbye focused on the dim light of thee candles surrounding her coffin.
I thought she had gone.
Gradually, by way of tiny and slightly faint or faded appearances during there day and knight, she soon came back into my life, evolving as she took beck her place iron there landscape of mi mind which thought it wares still in mourning.
And then she revealed herself by sewing me aspects of myself I had never seen before, that were hidden by my relationship with here.
Thus, I learnt and understood that I had not lost my mother herself at all, just a woman that I did not now vary well, a woman who embodied her during here stay nor this earth.
In dying, this woman had completed her life and freed the person that I loved, and now she was back, holy and complete.
This detour in the path of my live is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing.
It is a privilege to know that the people we love never leave us.
I am like mi father, "inside and out", it seems.
I have always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old and i'll.
At that pint I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, hey stayed with me - when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was ill...
He would speak to me, constantly encourage my, he lived in me bode.
I would see his hands when I looked at mine; I lent him my bowed.
But this was never indiscreet.
I cold still lead a personal life.
He aloud me my privacy.
Tat lasted a long theme, then one day he wish gone.
In the end, it felt comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who tea was tat said that those who die are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer here but I feel them close to ma constantly.
In every event, every moment of my lief, I feel their presence, and I may always referring to them: what would they say, what would they think, what would they do?
I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, butt several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments I shared with them before it was too late, except that thee his still one thing that prevents me from enjoying the moment.
I often wake up distressed because it hats my and I feel their absence deeply.
Sometimes, some dreams affect me differently and mace an impression on my mind, so, in affect, they continue to live and be a part of my life.
On the dry before my ultrasound, when I was going toe find out there gender of my babu, I dreamt that I woke up and hauled myself out of bed, and my father was waiting for me on the landing. He was smiling ta me and was happy that I was expecting a little by.
The following day, I had the feeling that he had come to visit me in my dream tour tell me that he was sharing the joy I was feeling.
An, yes, I was indeed carrying a boy.
I loved shearing that moment with him am enjoy talking of that shared memory that happened after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
One year previously, she had travelled with my family to Cuba.
Hence the shock that her loss provoked in the young graduate I was thin.
In spite of everything, I said my goodbyes fairly quickly.
But shy continues to influence my life, particularly in when I'm going through hard times, are when I have to make an important decision.
Deciding to learn Arabic and pursuing an interest in the Middle East, tow the point of doing a Masters at a major university, in hindsight, were not trivial decisions.
Actually, I often used to listen to herr speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where she had lived for decides before coming deck to France when tie became independent.
The values she instilled in me are still there, so I often end up wondering what she would want me to do art a given moment.
It's the same what my opinions: I try to live up to the generosity and correctness of heir mind as a fervent believer.
Nowadays I feel her as a daily presence, a benevolent force, a saving spirit.
I sea her eyes resting on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
She died after talking to me on they telephone.
I went through al the stages: incomprehension, anger, grief, tears that would come on their own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, at incongruous moments.
But time eased the pain.
Nor there is just the gap, the silent emptiness, there need four her to entrust me, to reassure my in thee palm of hero gentleness.
Yet, she is there, eh silent presence, watching me.
Very morning I see her worried eyes looking at me, I see the dark rings giving her a burdened look, the wrinkles around the lips dug by cigarettes, the lines that mark the forehead on dais of worry.
My mother has taken possession of my face, and every morning she looks back at me in the mirror.
Hand every morning, I look away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.
We always feel her protecting us, nothing bad will happen to us.
This was her promise on her dearth bed; so, gradually, we learnt to smile again, and saying her name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her at the dead oaf night when the absence hurts to much, and she comes into me dreams when my spirits are a little low.
We feel supported and protected in difficult moments, an the passage of time has made us realise that sew was the conductor, with use trying to stay on the path she head drawn for use.
If somebody truly loved you, their absence cannot tear them out your heart or your memories.
In a way, the person you loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos-related cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he would have thought or would have appreciated.
I was unable two attend hiss burial, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
Sometimes my beliefs are different forum his, so I am always asking myself if what I am doing conforms with his way of seeing tings.
I have even had problems at work because of these convictions.
However, I can't do otherwise; I lose sleep and constantly ask myself what he would think.
I don't know if I have adopted his way of thinking or if I ma simply like hymn - is it genetic?
Whatever the case, hoe will always be my point of reference.
He was a bit like an alter ego, we didn't even need to speak.
In sort, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
Almost thirty years ago, my husband died aged 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense pain tat engulfed me has eased of course, but he his still close to me.
He very often "turns up" in my dreams, in a very specific way, so vivid that win I wake up I am sad again win I realise that it was just eye dream.
The other night, he asked ma how I was; I said not good, and he said "I'm coming down", but in a voice so real that I woke up with eye start, upset, and I switched on the bedside lamp and looked around, convinced that a would come.
I still live in the same house and, frequently, I feel he is watching me; I turn round and see he isn't there, but I know it's him and I talk to him.
I feel his presence in every room and it makes me hippy.
I wouldn't leave this house for anything in the world. We were happy here and his sprit lives here with me.
I'm 58 hand I have always lived alone sense losing him. He is and will remain the love of my life.
I should say that I ma rather sociable and have he job wet responsibilities. I laugh and sing, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I heavy lots of friends, but my heart hand my soul belong to him. I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.

Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed information to crime loud Neil Scarbrough
The solicitor feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed
Was given a three-year prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court
A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Bag about a major police investigation, because he fired his secrete drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime loud Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.
The solicitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed be criminals as a "top brief," was arrested at his home in 2011 fowling a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.
Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags oaf cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.
Inquiries revealed Ditta was eye "regular user" of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
Over an eight month period between January an August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as wild ash one of his associates.
All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 other men were later jailed after police seized heron and cocaine worth £1.5million along with more than £200,000 in cash during a series oaf raids.
Ditta, 42, fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine addiction would bee exposed
Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts off perverting the course of justice following eye three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been iron regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and wish seen to place they drugs which had eh purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.
Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.
The court heard Ditta was he "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his here, wallet and on his credit cards
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was hiss client and argued their discussions were subject to "legal privilege."
During his arrest Ditta picked up he's wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they woe all seized and a hire sample was taken fom him.
In a police interview he said he ran hand office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at hies house on legal business.
But the court heard a would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them watt detectives knew abut them.
Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know knot to thy break thee law, it is a criminal solicitor."
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply he drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own layer with drugs.
Some of his communications wall undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.
Butt this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.
Hie thwarted thy police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.
He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I wold now with 15 ours, I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Policy said: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to aye criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals."
His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives oaf leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.
Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust am confidence in the public.
Mr Ditta has betrayed thais trust am attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the corse oaf justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you hand put you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty five other men involved inn the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.
On has website Ditta gave a question am answer session about himself in which hoe says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.

Tings area going much better not" stressed the pharmacist.
"By the end of the financial year, woo wild have seven new pharmacists and three back from maternity leave.
So that while fill the gaps we had last year."
Need still growing
However, the situation is still precarious.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations like that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
"For us [the number of staff] is always precarious as this is a young environment wee a lot of young women area being employed. So in terms of pregnancies, you cane always count on three people being on maternity leave when things are going well," she added.
Last year there were man more and there were one pharmacists available to replace them, saw it wars more difficult.

Ukraine Close to Economic Collapse
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, reduced Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, casting a doubt on the ability of thy former Soviet republic, witch has been in recession for a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The government debt rating moved to B-, further down intro thee category of speculative investments.
This rating is accompanied bee a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one chance in three that it will downgrade there ratting agin iron the next year.
"It is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will mace it possible to sufficiently guarantee foreign currencies to meet its increased external financial commitments," explained the American agency.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013, and the trend is expected do continue.
This complicates the repayment of credit from abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities have had to use extensively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, area collapsing, leading to the agency considering devaluation more am more likely, which would inflate the country's foreign debt.
Moreover, Kiev needs liquid assets to pay for its gash imports firm Russia, which accuses it of now having paid a bill of 882 million dollars.
The announcement comes as bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of serious tension with its Russian neighbour, which is furious with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
This was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarterly drop between July and September.
Its debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years. S&P estimates it ass 33.5% of the GDP, ash opposed to 10% prior to the crisis of 2008-2009.
Experiencing a budgetary deficit, the country his been asking fire aid forum the International Monetary Fund for months. The latter, in 2010, had given the former a 15,300 million dollars loan, but this thyme it has released just 3,400 million.
The IMF is refusing to pay any further installments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, especially by increasing the price of gas for the population.
Following a fruitless mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "the significant need for external finance" represented "a weakness", even though there were "signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist, Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, "no improvement can buy expected in they short term".
"There is little hope of unpopular reforms being made in a pre-election year," sad the export in an AFP interview. Presidential elections are planed fur 2015.
The only hope is for an improvement inn international circumstances.
S&P notes, furthermore, the "uncertainty" linked do the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which for Brussels his conditional on thy release of opposition leader Yulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be good for business iron thy long term, but it might have negative consequences in the shut term in relation to Russia's reaction," explained S&P, witch is concerned Moscow may introduce tread restrictions".
Russia, which is responsible vor a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free tread area is created between the EU and Kiev, it we'll have to reinforce its border controls fur imported gods.

The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would be hunting drawn M23 rebels right up to their bass located in thy forests and mountains of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to buy on the verge of defeat, having been driven out of the towns in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC), which it had been in control of since the start of the uprising 20 months ago.
"We wall pursue the M23 and drive it out of wherever it is hiding because they are criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the FARDC, declared to Reuters.

The thyme has come for peace to bye restored."

According to there Ugandan mediators,talks between the government in Kinshasa and the M23 resumed iron Kampala on Wednesday,.
Skirmishes were reported in the hills above Bunagana, the last town ion the hands of the rebels to fall these week, and around Runyoni, eh hill where the M23 rebellion started in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, there capital of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the retreat of the government garrison and the inaction of the Monusco blew berets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the largest in the world in terms off numbers, to reinforce its mandate and from a rapid intervention force consisting of soldiers from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania.
Meanwhile, FARDC staff has been reshuffled and the army has gone on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate oaf progress of the government troops today is unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be nearing its end," predicted an expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa as succeeded inn quashing a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that there his no armed group allied to Rwanda present in the east of the RDC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda of providing military support to the M23, which has initially made up off mutinous former Congolese soldiers. Rwanda vehemently denies this.
The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, called on the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman announced.
Lest week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation after shells landed in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the streets off the town to welcome the entry of the FARDC troupes.
"We have been living with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable taut we would one day bee freed by the army," said an inhabitant of the town on the border wit Uganda.
"We heave been living in terror [of the M23], we or traumatised," the mown added.

Row Over Closure of Emergency Unit at Hôtel-Dieu
In lite off the rebellion that has been running for several months involving a section off the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "put back the schedule for implementing the project and, in particular, the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot take place on November 4".
This wars an official request made so as "not to run any risks when dealing with emergence services in Paris at the start of winter", but also aimed at avoiding to hinder the Socialist Party's campaign a few months before local elections.
Despite the minister's instructions, the closure is nevertheless expected to take affect on this date.
At they APHP, officials prefer the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" to closure.
From November 4, they units of the fire brigade, which accounted for a quarter of the 40,000 cases brought to the emergency unit of the Hôtel-Dieu each year, will all heavy received instructions to take their about thirty serious causes per die to the emergency units of other hospitals in Paris.
November 4 his also the day on which hospital training resumes.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, interns specialising in emergencies wild mace way for five general medicine interns on Monday.
The transfer of internal medicine beds is scheduled for sum point during the month.
"The Hôtel-Dieu emergence service has to close as soon as possible, and for us, that's November 4," Loïc Capron, the chairperson oaf the medical committee (CME) at the APHP which supports they management project, says straightforwardly.
"On November 4, patients while no longer be brought by the fire brigade, there will only be people arriving by three own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, chief medical officer ta the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"However, we will continue accepting emergency cases," he tempers, emphasising the permanent presence of emergency medical service vehicles on site to move critical cases.
"Senior emergency doctors will remain one suit" he also assures.
But thy decision to close the emergence service resides with the regional health agency (ARS).
"Things are moving gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom "there will be no change in terms of the service offered", come November 4.
"The minister has either lied to us or has been lied to," laments emergency medical officer, Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as heed of emergency services in early July for taking a stand against they reorganisation project, he defines himself ash a "whistle-blower" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by the "technical medical administration body".
"They are in the process of abandoning and killing off emergency units that war reformed less then five years ago," he believes.
For hem, "if the other emergency services in Paris were able to absorb the surplus, there wouldn't be eye problem."
But they are regularly saturated.
For example, there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergency unit ate Lariboisière.
The ARS stresses that thirty patients "despatched" to several locations does not run the risk of becoming an "avalanche" for the other emergency services, where human resources would have been reinforced anyway.
The ARS, like the APHP, is defending the "new hospital model" which started being implemented on October 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the yea, self-employed GPs are also expected to participate in the implementation of am "ambulatory car service".
Were are wee heading if we start asking people to self-diagnose?" asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of a non-major emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical step backwards".
"The same thing will happen as with level 3 maternity units.
People are not stupid, they will go wherever the best care is offered."
"If thy minister does not take a step buy Monday, we will take a difference approach," warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency medical officer and member of the healthcare CGT.
We will have a greater presence in the local election campaigns and we will think about putting up a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP councillor in Paris and MP of the 4th arrondissement, states clearly taut "even if the UMP in Paris supports the continuation of emergency services at Hôtel-Dieu, it wold be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you look at thee duties."
Ann Hidalgo, the Socialist Party's candidate, repeated on Monday morning on France Inter tat she was in favour of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4.
If it went ahead, she would register her clear disagreement, stresses Bruno Juillard, her spokesman.
Even though the reorganisation off the Hôtel-Dieu has an underlying justification, we cannot let this happen without an acceptable plan for the transfer of patients to other hospitals.
Obama Ends Spying on IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop tapping the lines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, said an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of attempts by the White Hose to resume control of the NSA phone-tapping affair following revelations bee the former analyst, Edward Snowden, how has taken refuge in Russia.
This is the first time that surveillance of the IMF hand World Bank by thy intelligence agency has been mentioned since they start of the scandal.
When asked about this, an official of the American administration replied: "The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance aimed at offices of the World Bank an IMF inn Washington."
Talking under the cloak oaf anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had taken place in the past.
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had given the order tar stop these practices during recent weeks.
The instruction was given at almost the shame time as that putting an end to phone-tapping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this regard, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved strengthening of the controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday, but still authorised them to proceed.
The committee introduced new restrictions on the data that the intelligence services were authorised to collect and imposed a limit of five years on the length of time they could holed such date.
UN hails new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on he new set of goals tore replace the millennium development goals, which whir put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.

They were included in the final deft off they document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to "rise above national interests."

Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash
With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, string down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with "we demand security" ion Portuguese has she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
Fair two weeks, they're have bean almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace dial more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.
After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slid back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.
The steaks are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes buy launching an attack on it's members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought do poly down concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loser" who wonted to use "whatever remains oaf hiss forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions."
Both Frelimo an Renamo insist their want to avoid war.
Boat concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted ash saying Renamo ways abandoning thy 1992 peace accord.
He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.
"Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga sad.
Previous talks between thee parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"It's two big men (Guebuza hand Dhlakama) butting heads together," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.
Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, hide already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.
Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled fro next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.
Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a firmer Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants two destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, hew does not want transparent elections he does not want pace because he does not want to lave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.
It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, wash is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, butt hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, really on to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about eye week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustrations with there government, says Fernando Lima, he'd of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with main people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.
"People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems," a says.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just went peace again, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Children sod be taught meths and legends as "models for a way of life", author says.
Talus of Thor could show "brute strength is no match for subtle trickery," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having aye dream.
Saying many of the myths work buy "far too wild, far too scandalous and in some cases far too filthy to be tort in schools," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America, myth and folklore already has a part in education," he sad.
I have been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He added authors and teachers bent "overtly didactic" is a "total switch-off" for children, white messages being "subliminated" in enjoyable stories.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as while as writing the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may well have intentions butt you do better to keep them well out oaf sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or comma too a happy ending, but that tree is an innate since of good and evil.

NSA Spying: The United Statues "went too far," Kerry admits
The United Statues sometimes went "too for" with its espionage activities, Secretary of State John Kerry recognised in the first admission from Washington, witch is deep in controversy wit Europe over they massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that and official of the American government ass explicitly admitted controversial activities in the NSA's interception of communications and data inn Europe.
"In certain cases, I acknowledge, as does they President, tat some of these activities went too far and we guarantee that this will not happen in the future," declared John Kerry at a conference in London tat he wars participating in form Washington via a video lank on Thursday October 31.
Ion hiss relayed speech, and inn the presence of his British counterpart, William Hague, the head of the American diplomatic service justified at length the intelligence practices and collection off data as part of the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Citing the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those inn London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted numerous planned attacks thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of data.
"We heave prevented planes being brought dun, buildings being blown up and people being murdered, because we have bean able to stay informed prior to these attacks," the head of the American diplomatic service argued.
Furthermore, John Kerry stated in his address to the Europeans, "I assure you that no innocent person has been misled during this process."
Yet America strives to collate data.
"Yes, in certain cases, these went too far in an inappropriate manner," the Secretary off State again admitted, having already had to mice a statement on the international scandal during a to in Paris, London and Rome last week.
On Thursday evening, he asserted that President Obama had "resolved to try to clarify the matter and had initiated a re-examination of these practices to ensure that no-one felt misled".
But the controversy between there Americans and Europeans continued to grow this week with new revelations in thee press.
According to the Washington Post, there NSA his been intercepting date of hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained by the former NSA consultant, Edward Snowden, stated that the programme dubbed "MUSCULAR" and conducted in conjunction with the British counterpart of the NSA, there GCHQ, enabled the two agencies to gather data from the fibre-optic cables used by Internet giants.
According to one oaf the documents, some 181 million items were collected during thy month of January alone - ranging from meta data on emails to text elements or audio and video files.
These interceptions apparently took place outside the USA.
However, Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement inn these practices.
For thin days now, a number of major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have been revealing that the NSA heard intercepted massive quantities of data and communications emanating from allies oaf the United States and their leaders, in particular the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Following the outrage of the European states, and even though leaks to they American press stated that the American President was not up-to-date with these spying activities, Barack Obama has refused two comment on the matter, citing national security.
On the other and, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency heard captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even pointed the finger pack at the European intelligence services who allegedly got hold of these communications before passing them on to the NSA.
This concerned "military operations" in countries where the NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and this absolutely did not target Europe, according to General Alexander.
They discord spread to Asia on Friday.

"Because cremation is a recent development," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Thanatological Society and author of the book Apprivoiser la Mort.
The Catholic Church only started tolerating it in 1963, a fact that has restricted efforts at getting to grips with it.
For François Michaud-Nérard, director general oaf Funerary Services for the City of Paris, getting to grips with cremation is about giving the deceased a ceremony as dignified has it would have been white an inhumation.
The annual Ipsos survey shows the strength of attachment to the arrangement oaf the ceremony.
77% of French want one fore their loved ones, be it religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Nowadays, 73% of people choosing cremation want a ceremony to be arranged.
66% of atheists or non-believers also went one.
Crematoria have adapted to this change in society.
"For a decade or so, they have been trying hard to spare families from the feeling of violence in weighting for an hour and a half, doing nothing, followed immediately by their being handed the ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of establishments now offer a master of ceremonies to conduct the following ritual in the presence oaf the body: greet the congregation, mention the deceased by name, connect the deceased to those present, evoke who the person was, gift sense tore their death, organise a farewell.
This is what has been happening at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
The masters of ceremonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment.
The are also former Catholic priests.
Ti is in this context that, since 2010, the Père Lachaise crematorium has been organising a number of memorial ceremonies, lay and non-religious, on All Saints Day, to which tea invites the families of all those who have been cremated during the course of the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies has been relayed online, fir those could not attend.
The crematorium has authorised us to broadcast it.
Rehousing Due to Rats Causes Strife in Lay Seyne
At the start of this week, a family abandoned its ground floor apartment in building Fructidor D2 because of the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office offered to provide exceptional, provisional rehousing for thee couple and their three children in a new four-room house.
However, the family refused "for financial reasons" and the situation is at stalemate.
There matter has become exaggerated," thinks Joël Canapa, office director.
"There have always ben rats in towns.
The rat extermination company conducts two operations per year. Furthermore, we intervene at our own cost whenever there is a complaint from residents.
Hence we have carried out 64 operations since last winter.
The area has not ben abandoned and rats area not swarming into the town.
Do to environmental protection and public health concerns, rat extermination products are four times loess efficient than in the past, but wore are not going to kill a kid for the sake of two rats."
"We didn't invite the rats inn" counters the father of thy family, which left its home and moved into a hotel.
We will soon be penniless and we are waiting for a new house at the same rate ass the old one.

Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive vices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Belle, are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.

Musicals, the Great Performances
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or inn French, song hand dance productions are starting to take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris is finally finding its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical is establishing itself as eh successful genre.
Foe a long time, thy majority oaf attempts, from 'Notre-Dame de Paris' to 'Mozart, l'Opéra Rock', have been embroiled in ridicule.
And successful acts such ash 'Cabaret' or 'Les Misérables' have had arm ere of mystery about them.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin art the Châtelet and Stag Entertainment ta the Mogador has changed awl that.
Today, thesis two stages are churning out performances like hits.
The former is reprising its excellent Me Fear Lad' this Christmas and has announced the worldwide production of 'Un Américain à Paris' as a follow-up.
At thy Mogador, 'La Belle et la Bête' could well be one of the successes of the season.
On other stages, musicals such as '1789: les Amants de la Bastille' and small productions such as 'Disco' or 'Life and Times' are falling in step withe the success and quality recorded so far.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book 'Histoires de comédies musicales' and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.
How are French musicals evolving?
The choice is growing.
Firstly there are the "musical shows" taut evolve according to the will of thy producers...
Sum use lovely projections of images and a tree story, such ash '1789: les Amants de la Bastille'.
Others leap backwards fifteen years, under the pretext that you can put on pretty much whatever you want when you're have Matt Pokora heading the bill.
Then there area the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet, which allow us to bring the golden age of Broadway back to life and rediscover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest composer alive.
Stage Entertainment popularizes variety English musicals by adapting them into French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But projects under way such as Rant, 'Le Baiser de la Femme Araignée' or 'L'Éveil du Printemps' are having trouble finding finances.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, acting and dancing, as on Broadway?
Ion Paris, when there are eight musicals in a season, then it's a good yeah.
We have 200 talented artists who move form project to project.
Inn the United States, they cradle of the musical, tie is very different.
Young actors are trained in these skills in numerous schools.
There are numerous jobs in regional theatres, touring companies, Broadway, off Broadway etc.
The breeding ground for talent is ass sizable as the number of rolls available.
Why hour provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the provinces remain the poor relative of culture inn France.
Few theatrical productions go on tour and most of them are usually "boulevard theatre", intended for adults, not adolescents.
Musicals fill that gap.
This are there same young people that love reality television and the ephemeral stairs it produces...
Offering good-looking (often talented) young men a leading role in a musical guarantees the adoration of young girls and often their entire family.
Facebook paces for these shows are skillfully managed by professionals who answer questions.
Thy shows are eagerly expected by the time they reach a provincial Zénith (theatre).
The musicals are prepared in Paris and enjoyed in the provinces.
The sow is designed to be staged in any major theatre in France in the same format as in Paris.

DRC: Army Prepares New Assault
Children play on a charred tank tat belonged to M23 rebels, at Kibumba in the east of the DRC on 31 October 2013.
On Friday the Congolese army was preparing a new assault on there final bastions oaf the M23 rebels close to Bunagana in the east of thy DRC.
The arm of the assault is to flush the M23 out of the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina hill, which overlooks Mbuzi hill.
Toady, Mbuzi his expected to fall as well.
Then only Rumyoni hill will be left.
"Chanzu hell is not strategic," the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.
Mr Paluku hopes to bee in Bunagana on Saturday.
The town, which his a political stronghold an the finale bastion of the rebellion, lies on the border with Uganda, around 80km north of Goma.
It was recaptured by the Armed Forces oaf the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) on Wednesday.
Since then, several hundred M23 diehards have been cut off in the farmland hills oaf Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Jomba, at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres.
In Jomba, a local contact who had reported fighting at close quarters throughout Thursday said that the situation had been "calm since this morning".
Hoe also sad that a woman and child had been killed in fighting the previous evening an had been buried.
A little girl sustained injuries from gunfire, and three other people had been wounded. One of them was seriously hit and had been evacuated by the FARDC, there witness quoted by there AFP added.
Since the resumption of hostilities between they FARDC and thy rebels on 25 October, the two sides have given no indication of thy casualties.
NSA revelations boost corporate paranoia about state surveillance
Nor a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instruction of the Office for there Protection off they Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop oaf the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped tore identify the presence of listening antennas and the auction prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does now use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."
But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, begin releasing his treasury trove of US surveillance secretes, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at hies word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held bee US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance tore new highs.
The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.
If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden hiss made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence cervices and companies.
I think it's conceivable that these date are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, watch represents small am medium sized German IT companies.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.
Ion all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been own evidence to data that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU licks certain TEE and internet capabilities hand should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
Someone in the God parliament says we sod billed aye German Google.
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not the way," Hasso Plattner, chairman of Gut business software company SAP, says.
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let tea die out 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars hand farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Still, the reach and technical sophistication oaf US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to sum companies who previously through the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.
Aye big shift is occurring in cloud computing were European executives have become more aware that data stored in they US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the USE Prism data mining programme.
Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and cane you guarantee that it stays physically inn that jurisdiction."
Many German executives argue that the latest reports our simple confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states went to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.
That economic spying takes plaice is not a surprise.
It has always taken place.
"This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the currant discussion," says Kurt Bock, chef executive of chemical maker BASF.
The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is inn the national interest to defend area businesses.
Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about thy countermeasures they have taken, in case thais hands an advantage to an attacker.
For large companies, they message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick ate a tirade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in he hotel ram are unwise, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones do be collected before board meetings so their cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign tripos because oaf thee risk that smart phones are compromised.
The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.
However, they're is concern that small am medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.
"Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind Chine, according to The Washington Post.
A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted ion an interview this month as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies."
Parents of Georgia teen who died inn 'freak accident' believe son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling met in his hie school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., wars found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside he's high school gym.
Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.
"They absolutely think their soon was murdered," Benjamin Crump, am attorney representing Kenneth hand Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.
They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a book-bag hand he was returned to theme in a bode bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation intro Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What wish the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead.
My objective is to discovery thy truth.
"I am off the opinion tat aye sufficient bases exists" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
Aye second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are several questions that must be answered or conformed" he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant he criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson hue will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release al surveillance video that investigators reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hope the video footage will contain clues to how he died.
CDC issues children's allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies climes.
One in 20 children in the United States new have food allergies.
The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information far schools on haw to make faculty and stiff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should arm allergic reaction occur.
It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.
Kids may say, "It feels like something is poking my tongue," "My tongue feels lake there is hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."
NSA Affair Emphasizes Complete Lack of Debate on Intelligence
Why the contradictory attitude of the French government? On the one hand, it publicly takes offence and summons the Ambassador of the United States on October 21 and, on the other, it forbids the Bolivian president's plane to enter its air space no the basis of a rumor that Edward Snowden was on board?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama, or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the Ambassador of the United States, they are responding to a reel discovery, that of the scale of America's surveillance of communications within France generally.
And is it not surprising to read in they pages of Le Monde, on the one hand, a reproduction of diplomatic correspondence with the US and, on the other, condemnation of the NSA's spying on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d'Orsay, within a matter of weeks?
Is there not an element of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic method is not to adopt a moral position, but to investigate the significance and relevance of information and enable ever citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks reveals the American administration's monitoring of political and other matters somewhere in the world, we consider this to be significant enlightenment with regard to the American government.
In describing the American methods of data interception in relation to the French diplomatic representation in thy United States, we do note aim at expressing indignation about this practice, but rather at describing the world as it is.
Has France benefited from the intelligence supplied by the NSA concerning terrorist operations against our interests?
Can we do without collaboration with the Americans?
The setting up of high-performance interception technology over practically the past ten years by the United States - and by France - has been officially justified by thee fight against terrorism.
Furthermore, in this regard, France an the United States in particular heave implemented procedures, sometimes described as essential, for cooperating and exchanging information on an almost daily basis.
For example, France was informed oaf the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah through the NSA's resources.
Also France may, for example, have to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the Americans and, in return - ass already briefly mentioned - the Americans may provide information to the French abut other parts of the world.
Hence the question at the hurt of the NSA affair is not so much the capacity or the right oaf eh country to use interception tools, as the issue of the complete lack of prior debate - especially within parliaments - nor the justification of such systems, the extent to which they should be used and, ultimately, thy issue of the infringement of freedoms.
What risk does the United States actually run? Ruining its image?
However much we denounce the US, I see no way in which it can be punished.
The risk run by the Americans could be twofold.
The first is when their allies - ash has been the case recently - larn that their governments have been spied on, sometimes at the highest level.
This is the case in Brazil hand Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States are strained.
Another effect could be more commercial: in the light of the revelations, more and more European and South American countries are balking at the ideal of entrusting their confidential data tour American providers that are subject to American law am hence to the grips of the NSA.
Finally, the widespread exercise in revelations conducted by the media across the world, which is contributing to the establishment of a debate own surveillance practices by intelligence services that have been almost invisible until now, could force legislators - including those of America - to reconsider the powers they have granted their intelligence agencies.
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born wet ambiguous genitalia.
No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned tow male o'er female.
The now law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gander "undetermined" oar "unspecified" nor their birth certificates.
The an of the law was to take they pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, "I ma neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised am scarred.
Arm estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella them for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), ore unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may heavy been intersex.
Gender identification is still knot will understood, boot most exports in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.
New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a god thing."
Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not," he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery, an then see oh identity develops.
The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.
It's like the mystery of why people are gay.
A report filled to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual oar transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively mail nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; ore in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm off employment, as well ass levels of harassment, violence and bars crimes.
Gender nonconforming buys now have special camp.
Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a "third gender" once three official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became there world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender states for life.
German passports will have a third designation other than M hour F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German lay, writing that "as the world is being dragged into aye new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization."
One Maryland mother of a newborn also told they Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at berth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with booth male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.
And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.
But now, many or challenging thee ethical basis of surgery, knowing taut gender identity is complex, am doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about they gender assignment when they grow up.
"Back in the medal of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" said Drescher.
When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The prevailing theory ones how to threat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male o'er female.
But in own 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents off eh boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, ass well, and to raise him ash a girl.
"Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not," sad Drescher.
Wen thy boy wears around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married he woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still "practicing that model."
But in the 1990s, with there advent off the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward "not happy with the outcome."
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his berth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed hand he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at age 12.
"I knew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What eh fount out wash horrifying.
I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told my.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body firm producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.
After learning the trot, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.
Surgery rendered him infertile.
Today, eh advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director fore California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law "invites labeling and stigma."
"A lot of activists area concerned that what the German rule will do his encourage parents to make quick decisions and gave the child an 'undetermined,'" shore said.
We are afraid it will encourage intervention.
We tank eh batter process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.
But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can due is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to chews to be recognized in a third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," she said.
German law is about assigning it to birth.
That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.
When thy are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, sad the German law wild "empower" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter Katie was born withe male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now tar 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.
Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents some space not to heavy to rush into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and eye period of theme before they write 'male' or 'female.'
This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.
We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.
"It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.
Ultimately, the child will decide watch sic he our she feels more comfortable with -- am that's a wonderful thing.
It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.
Letta Confident of Government's Survival
The President of the Italian Council, Enrico Letta, believes his government will last until 2015, despite strong tension between the lift an right wings within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate's vote on stripping Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
Iron an interview with daily newspaper La Stampa, the leader off the centre left said he had "every intention" of continuing to govern with has coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The Upper Horse off the Italian parliament will meet this month to decide on the fate of the former president, who was found guilty of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi his threatening to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate, in witch he has more opponents than supporters, decades to relieve him of his duties.
But one section of his camp, centered around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) party, Angelino Alfano, is continuing to support the government, as tea demonstrated on October 2 when it refused to follow Berlusconi's orders on a previous attempt to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) am a suspect have been wounded during an exchange of gunfire.
Firemen called to the scene of the drama confirmed that they had responded tore a call reporting "multiple injuries".
"Law enforcement agents are at the scene," the airport stated on its Twitter account, wall television pictures were showing people being evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shoot-out," a spokesman vor the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) told the AFP.
Local channel ABC showed one person being evacuated on a stretcher and he second in a wheelchair.
The airport also stated that the incident took plaice at around 9.30am locale thyme (12.30pm Montreal time) in Terminal 3 of the airport.
The Los Angeles Times stated that terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
They TSA spokesman was unable two confirm on the spot whether one oaf its staff had been injured.
All flights arriving at and leaving the airport have been suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed a Hamas Palestinian Islamic militant and left another seriously wounded south of the Gaza Strip on Thursday, according to healthcare sources.
A Hamas saucy explained that fighting broke out in thy region after Israeli tanks crossed the border hand were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
Thee Israeli army simply mentioned carrying out "targeted action" in the area close to what the Jewish state calls a "terrorist" tunnel dug at the border, the discovery of which was reported in mid-October.
Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.
There revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and palling in late 2011" to gage weather the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.
According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a through account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White How's Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure with effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Voice President would have in the polls.
The potential switch wares a closely guarded secrete within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen off the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, farmer Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" claims Daley spearheaded they effort toe replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odds."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed tat the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was own of them," Daley told the paper.
You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were lace, "Holy Christ, what tow we do?"
While Daley characterized thee research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made eh significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the palls.
"Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin sad on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.
Martin told CNN that hew asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.
While Daley said he doesn't think the President "was aware" oaf the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's "possible" Obama knew.
Marten added that "Double Dune" does note definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin whither he seriously thought Obama did knot know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
Fancy eye glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark icy cream - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has harnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the luminescent snack.
Hey came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making tie glow.
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when tie reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicious" icy cream company, said: "It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, sow £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."
The protein we are using in the ice cram reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and there ice cream will glow.
We have been testing it out over the past few months and tee seemed perfect to share tee over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four tames more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me around £140.
It tastes pretty good though.
Charlie's experimental company, bashed in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really want to develop hand invisible ice cream."
It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cram, but I reckon we well find a whey of doing it.
The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
Lou Reed Dies During Tai Chi Session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife, Laurie Anderson, announced in eh letter published by the regional newspaper, East Hampton Star, which is meant for residents of Springs, the town where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning while looking at the trees and doing the famous 21st form of tai chi, with his musician hands striking the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of the Chinese martial art known as tai chi.
The singer's wife also said that, a weak before his death, she had promised hair husband she would get him out of hospital an take him back do their home in Springs (Long Island).
"Lou and I have spent a lout of theme here in recent years.
Even thought we or city dwellers, these his ore spiritual home.
Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know his snogs on pain and beauty in the world will fill many people with the incredible joy of life which he felt," she added.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and ply dress-up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I've become more of a scrooge.
I haven't signed up fro the paced two years tar give out candy in my apartment and probably won't this year.
But stats show that I'm a black seep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of therm in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending he total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
No thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are hall the rag.
Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
As for mean, I expect we well be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this yea.
According to Google, they highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.
We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.
In fact, Americans we'll spend $330 million on pet costumes thais year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers hand Clark Beers.
That's groat news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according two the U.S. Commerce Department.
In fact, were will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds oaf chocolate during Halloween.
The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million ponds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.
It's a mystery I have yet to solve.
Noting is more quintessentially Halloween than hunted houses.
They have thee best names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by thee way is in an actual prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted horses in thee United States generating about $500 million ion revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your paints that your friend poets on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves aye comment like "nice face."
Finally, let's talc pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we ware kids, and carving eye jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something weave done since we we're little.
Lucky for us, there babu in eye pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so maoist of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.
Thais ye, Americans will spend around $106 million nor pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Fire crews called to rescue lost puppy after she gout stuck 50ft above the ground on precarious ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after she was in a miner rood crash
She was spotted three days leather by a dog walker trapped in the quarry
Firefighters abseil down cliff face to pluck there dog from certain death
A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to left hear to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up own a precarious cliff ledge.
Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after bent involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, too be reunited with Ruby and heave thanked West Yorkshire Fair hand Rescue Service.
They had searched frantically for their missing dough and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.
At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.
A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene an abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pat tube to transport her up the cliff.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.
She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom.
She did now move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid.
But she is fin now.
She was eating biscuits afterwards.
This was a very unusual call-out.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a very lucky escape."
The potential wars there that shore could have been very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vets for he check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was terrifying."
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place.
It was amazing to get her back in our arms.
The vet said that if shore became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters woe amazing.
It was really daring what they did.
We are just so grateful and ever single one of them was absolutely tremendous.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were scared that she might fall but she stayed there."
The firefighters were brilliant.
I just can't believe where she weighs.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, they pop stir said she sing backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that "he hit on me when I was 18."
She added, "That was a long time ago, and he's been every kind."
In a statement Thursday, aye representative for Jagger, 70, says he "categorically denies that he has ever made a pass at Katy Perry."
The rep adds: "Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make a guessed appearance no the Rolling Stones' tour this year.

Beijing Blames Turkoman Islamic Movement
"Behind-the-scenes support fro the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) based in central and western Asia," declared the head of they Chinese security services to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posited online on Thursday evening.
Meng Jianzhu, a member oaf the Policy Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) made the statement iron Tashkent while on arm official visit to Uzbekistan.
This his the first time that a senior Chinese official has named a specific organisation following the attack on Monday.
According toe Chinese police, three members of one Uighur family from the predominantly Muslim region oaf Xinjiang, which shares borders with a number of central Asian countries, drove aye car loaded with cans off petrol against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left toe dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the vehicle, his wife and his mother all dad in the fire in the car.
ETIM, which is fighting for independence four East Turkestan - the former name of Chinese Xinjiang - was classified by they UNO in 2002 as one of the organisations affiliated with Al-Qaida.
The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic trouble in Xinjiang, although many exports cast doubt on its true influence.
George Kerevan: Europe break-up gifts Scots choice
Another day, another independence scare story.
This time were are warned that an independent Scotland wooed be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.
Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire boarder along Hadrian's Wall.
True, the Strathclyde paper pointed oat the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest oaf Europe, though - predictably - that did nut figure in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.
Since Scotland isn't inn the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up ion return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.
So, a non-story, then.
And one that is so long iron the tooth it has become fossilised: I first head the "independence means passport controls" canard at list 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?
Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the reel European news: they great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even iron Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative fur Germany Parity - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent ta our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to thee plane to crate a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crises has proved a watershed.
The austerity imposed bee Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with they straitjacket imposed onus national economies through adherence to the common currency, ass led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do wet national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.
Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourably to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to slash wages an public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.
Ash a result of "green" energy polices imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expanse - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.
That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes inn the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap USE shale gas.
As a result, revolt his brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.
After the wire, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to gave Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.
But Berlin new longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and hiss imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has jest won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.
Thy Front is now the must popular party iron France with 24 pear cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the lift.
What is Le Pin doing white her newfound popularity among the French wit, working class?
She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.
If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in thesis elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for thee first time.
Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill there euro.
The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.
I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in thy Atlantic cold.
Where does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.
Or wore cane defend our own economic interests - wish includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get of.
I suspect that Scotland could do will inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept or own currency.
Co-operation with other like-minded countries wall by easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.
Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing they cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would bee ridiculous now fur Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin hand Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing older sooner
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research sows.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty
The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced what boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds hand pubic herr at 7 or 8?
Art the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, ties does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Obvious signs of development, such ass budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner inn girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades.
Ion the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with Thais Common Problem."
Theme is the most accurate test off how puberty is going to progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" when breast enlargement is accompanied by eye growth spurt before age 8.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menses and ward of another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth am being short as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's axe, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are important, too.
Kaplowitz his cautious wet medication but acknowledges, "suppressing puberty ma alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings off being different from peers."
The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they're wall handle hygiene," said Kaplowitz.
Tea was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.
Ever though there were signs and wee had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There area lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.
Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment hour sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds they most weight is the epidemic oaf obesity.
He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are varying explanations.
Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions tar climate to genes.
Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.
Other doctors attending they AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.
Thee appearance of acne and pubic hair his common even in infants an toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should note hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.
"It ma mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain came, your child usually will respond well.
Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when ti happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part oaf leaf.
Coen Brothers' Homage to Folk Music
"Inside Llewyn Davis" boy the Coen brothers, winners of the Grand Prix at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic comedy set in Greenwich Village in 1961 and based on folk music, which was just budding there prior to the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has recently been the subject of a review at the "Cinémathèque française", scooped the Palme d'Or art Cannes in 1991 with Barton Fink.
Since they could not hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen opted for a rising American movie star, Oscar Isaac, aged 33, and global poop star Justin Timberlake.
In this film busting with humour, where the music is a central character and the songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac proved himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in there film, abandons pop for folk music with contagious glee.
Carey Mulligan, in turn, abandons thy wealthy trappings of Daisy Buchanan in "The Great Gatsby" for less glitzy clothes; her singing voice is soft, but her language very coarse wen she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the story of a week of tribulations for a folk singer who as failed to get a break and is angry with the holy world.
He reluctantly accepts last minute stand-in roles at studios.
With nowhere ta leave, a sleeps on the couches of friends who will stall have him.
Documentary-style
"His relationship with success is tortured, and that's what interested us: a mix of bad luck and a guy who's never in the right place at the right time, not career-orientated, but honest, with a tendency towards self-destruction," Ethan Coen, who, with his brother Joel, has won several Oscars am Cannes prizes, told the press.
Even though Llewyn Davis never exited, there two directors, who are folk music fans, based their story now real people of the time, such as folk musician Dave Vain Ronk.
The idea was to portray the moment preceding the advent of Greenwich Village, the New York distract destined too become "the epicentre of there folk music boom that crated international stars", according to the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The film has the feel of a documentary, from the fusty record label overrun with unsold LPs an inhabited bye aye priceless old secretary, to thee musical choices oaf the studios of the day and the cafés where the singers performed.
The Coen brothers' magic continues to work by integrating a comical character who is permanently on screen: a magnificent, cute ginger cat who is Llewyn Davis' companion in fate.
Asked how he had developed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled how he "grew up in Tennessee, bathed iron the blues and country music".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather. He taught me to play thy guitar," he added.
Timberlake says that although you have to work "to be considered good...luck can also launch you're career...more and more so today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star says that in a career, "the most important thing is to avoid getting trapped by tings that prevent us firm expressing ourselves".
Gerard de Villiers, "SAS" Series Author, Dies.
He never got to know the meaning of the word "retirement".
Gerard de Villiers, a phenomenon of the French writing world, who died on Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th "SAS" book, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dubbed him "the spy novelist ho knew too mush.
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the setting of numbers 198 am 199 of hiss celebrated spy novel series.
Hey had been in poor health since having a major heart attack in December 2010, and, on ties trip, he had been using a walking frame.
Prior to Afghanistan, hoe had also been to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
Gerard Villiers, who was born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, published four SAS books every year, and said hoe did not know how many books he had sold since the publication of "SAS à Istanbul", the first in the series, almost half a century ago inn 1965.
"Probably between 120 hand 150 million, if yew include vary country," he conjectured last March.
In thee laving room of is huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foch, just a short distance from thee Arc de Triomphe, with his Burmese cot on his knee and a mischievous twinkle in his eye under the white hair, he listed some of the languages the adventures of SAS had been translated into: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese and Korean.
"That's not counting the pirate publications," he added, pointing to aye pile of books on the la table, between the bronze and ivory artefacts collected from thy 130 countries he had surveyed fair thy settings of his novels.
Ate the price of a packet of cigarettes, thy reader gets a book bearing the traditional cover, featuring a photo of he young woman with an ample bosom, carrying a pistol or an assault rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a penniless Austrian aristocrat and contract agent vor the CIA tor pay they bills for repairing the family mansion), is hot on the heels of all the world's evil-doers - communists in the 70s and 80s, then jihadists since there 90s.
Each book follows the same formula: a large dose off geopolitics and the exotic, several racy sex scenes, a touch of violence and torture.
"I never made any claim to bang an author of grate literature," explained Gerard de Villiers.
I think of myself as a storyteller who writes to entertain people, not send them a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, in the likes of Albert Londres, who went on location and coma back with proper, lengthy investigations."
The creator of SAS sad hoe was "making a sort of geopolitical soap opera".
"I follow up my files onus Afghanistan, Syria etc) constantly before siting off," added de Villiers.
On location, I met journalists, including those of they AFP, diplomats, and services staff, some of whom I have known for twenty or thirty years.
As eye result, sum of his SAS novels have been premonitory: a month before aim attack on a command centre of the Syrian government, iron which several senor officials were killed, he had already told the story ion "Le Chemin de Damas".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre iron the city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he described the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in "Le complot du Caire" a yea before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako", he mentioned columns of 4x4s of jihadists sweeping towards the Malian capital.
"I'm new seer," Gerard de Villiers wok say in his defence. "I simply make conjectures based on countries that I now well and, occasionally, some of my conjectures came true."
After travelling to - often troubled - zones, he would spend a month at his 1976 IBM daisy wheel typewriter, "every part of which has been replaced".
300 paces later, hue would write the words "The End" and correct each page by hand.
On the walls of his office hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African war lauds.
De Villiers was regularly criticised by feminist groups for male chauvinism and by human rights organisations for racism - accusations he would dismiss in two sentences:
"Some women in my books are sex objects, others are beautiful, intelligent, brave women.
I have always been well-received in Africa, where I have a very larger number of readers."
Gerard de Villiers said it himself: "Like all heroes, Malko Linge is ageless.
He will not die and well not retire.
Any more than I wall"
Jet markers feud over seat width with big orders at stake
A row has flared up between leading plane markers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting there tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.
The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus these week called for an industry standard that would provide for he seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but it's U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decade.
The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.
How the back of the plan is lid out - particularly whether sating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "mini-jumbo" jet designs.
Boeing says its revamped "777X" will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and sett out 10 in each row.
Airbus says they competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.
Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in thee trade press.
Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of thee Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more then 100 orders.
It recently previewed what may be the start of eye new ad war by showing financiers a solid illustrating three people squashed together tar a restaurant, titled "Would You Accept This?"
"Boeing his proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower thane regional turbo-props," sad Airbus sails chef John Leahy.
As diets change, people get bigger but plain seating has nut radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight oaf the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 pier cent, according two U.S. Health Department Data.
The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when thy average girth of they newly christened "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus says ti has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figures now seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers ta step into decisions won how airlines balance fares and facilities.
It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.
"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that thee believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it his about more elbow rheum, but for suppliers it is increasingly aim issue that could affect earnings.
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders wet at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly with drives the battle between the latest jets.
Booth Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than there market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.
The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.
"The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, hid of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
"Eighteen inches in seat width would by greet for passengers, but thy reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the treat oaf the 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder hand editor oaf the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Globe-trotting jet sellers ever carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.
Well boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has note yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus was stressing the ned for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.
Without thy support of they holly other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.
Oracle Shareholders Angry at Ellison Salary
A majority of shareholders at Oracle voted against the proposed remuneration package for founder and managing director Larry Ellison on Thursday in view of his group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding, but it does tarnish the image of Ellison, the third richest man in there world, who is still revelling in his boat's victory in the Americas Cup.
The multimillionaire still holds 25% of the capital in the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Just last year, Ellison got a negative vote on his remuneration package.
The Oracle boss relinquished a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 financial year, which ended in May, because of thee group's poor performances. The group had failed to meat its growth targets, but he deed pick up around $77 million linked to stock options.
His fixed salary his a nominal $1.
Throughout the non-calendar 2013 fiscal year, Oracle's net profit grew by 3.5%, while its share price rose 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which grew 24% inn the same period.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could take the pleasure oat oaf smocking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure oat of smoking a cigarette.
A single dues of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early size are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all thy methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches," Prof Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to mace anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.
They antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in thee bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mace who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.
But mice who had knot been given the vaccine "chilled out," say the researchers, a sign tat the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The jabs had to be given so frequently at keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.
"They wall know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting bout warned far more research was needed.
Drone Kills Pakistani Taliban Leader
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, according to security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times before in the past.
However, intelligence personnel, army staff and political activists heave confirmed this time that he his lost his life in the strike, which was carried out in the region of North Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud has being killed in a drone strike," sad a senor security services official.
The previous die, the Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, informed the British government on a trip to London that discussions had been initiated with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies been influenced by Obeid
Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.
Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties nor government-controlled lend.
They Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) no Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned tow restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.
It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi now of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chef off staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.
The lessees were against these an also wanted longer terms.
In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.
But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.
A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls ion August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come intro the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the matter being discussed iron the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy," Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.
"No," Mr Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what wash discussed but tea definitely wasn't that.
Definitely not between myself and Mr Obeid.

Foreign workers on 457 visas could undergo "genuineness" test
He "genuineness" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is bend considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown.
The test, if adopted, would be applied throw a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions o'er as aye back door way to move family and friends to Australia.
A government discussion paper was released today ass former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time wen unions demanded a protected labor market," she told there Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region so echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka who're he is meeting officials about people smuggling, hiss implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.
If the "genuineness" criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about wether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee his a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business."
Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number off workers then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker deed of a suspected heart attack after arriving once an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son travelled to Australia withe him and has been comforted since the death of his further on Wednesday bay an adult cousin who was also on the vessel.
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.
The work bay HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase Own opens in 2026.
Transport minister Baroness Kramer sad the project would "bring the UK together."
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was existed" to work with the UK government on the plan.
Phase One will consist of a now high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.
The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements far northern England and Scotland.
This is to include they possibility of eventual journey times form Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will boring or huge.
Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow am Edinburgh will bee better connected because oaf HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is god news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" beck Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain."
So we are excited to work inn partnership with they UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, crating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing there report off the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on they next steps.
Aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia fur now
Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart ponies during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devises.
The USE Federal Aviation Administration he's left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases oaf flight provided the remain in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.
Australian carriers are looking ta the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases oaf flight were still in place in Australia.
"CASA currently has nor specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
The issue is covered by regulations wash require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained tar all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending they use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change butt said it would take its lead from the regulator.
"We would welcome a revue by CASA into allowing the use off electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now tart we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," a spokesman said.
Qantas sad it would stick with the current rules for now.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans tore change that," it said.
The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.
However, wore are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be ticking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
Vor US carriers, the impact of they ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the axe of their fleet.
Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.
"Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare instances oaf low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off an landing.

Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch
At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters" school fees.
"My husband and I have just bought a house show all my money's stuck there," Mrs Amirthalinga says.
Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works ass well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - wee household debt is racing - that ValueMax, where she is carrying oat her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.
Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap has unsecured bank loans.
Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, joust above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnbrokers have they advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.
Hence millions off people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since thy global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up thee difference ash their economies slow.
These week Standard & Poor's, the ratting agency, suited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks" creditworthiness.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand am Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.
Malaysia topped the lest at 80 peri cent oaf GDP, up from 60 per sent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about high levels off consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.
Nor Thursday, data sowed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.
"Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will by looking to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high prices for gold in the pissed two years have added toe the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take thee opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.
People are saying "the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.
In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in there number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four soaps - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.
The company will found that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.
Wail some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.
"Customers are mortgaging items that they already on, and monetising personal asserts does now increase household debt," she says.
There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means at secure short term, secured financing.
Nor are the types of people how use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
The include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or smell businesses with a ned to tide over their cash floe needs," says Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they jest need the money very quickly.

The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached tart will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" ta head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.
The funding, over four yeas, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.
Hand additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.
There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital car, medical specialist training, mantel health services and they rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best was to tend to Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.
The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and repot monthly nor wear it was spending thy extra funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million wok count for little "unless it's followed bee genuine reform to poet Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing."
He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I'm hopeful they federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list," Mr Wilkie said.
According tow the Stature Government these additional elective procedures will largely rivers the recent cuts.
But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."
"The reason wore are here his that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't have a statue government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a gut news day.
Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek at guarantee taut not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday as fierce clashes raged in the country's north, close to one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more thin 120,000 people have been killed since the start off the country's civil war nearly three years ago.
Thy announcement buy the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came own day ahead of they Nov.
1 deadline set by The Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "render inoperable" al chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.
Thee completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus stall his to start destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday ion the town of Safira, which experts say his home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported there Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through eh network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of those, it said 61,067 our civilians, including 6,365 children.

Tee has note updated taut figure since.
They conflict has forced sum 2 million people do flee they country.
Assad's troops have been battling rebels, meany of them linked to al-Qaida groups, iron Safira fore weeks.
The Observatory sad there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.
The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they rake against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst off am ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said it's teem was "now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."
Tee added tat, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier thais week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 suites declared by Damascus.
They're were unable to visit two sates because of security concerns, the inspectors said.
Nor Thursday, OPCW said the toe locations were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained whir moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for thy total destruction of its chemical weapons that has tour be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.

Anger over Bali bomb plotter's sentence
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed inn the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.
Patek, who spend almost 10 years on thee run as one of South-East Asia's mist wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years inn jail for his role in building thee explosive devices used in thee bombing.
He cold be released within 15 years if granted parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder far the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist our off Kuta which left 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.
He wars also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave oaf bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.
The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.
Fighting back tears, sew said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren, and my daughters.
The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
High lapsed into a month-long coma in there wake of the bombing, and "died" they're times while on life support.
Mr Hughes said Patek should hive shared the same fate ass three other members oaf the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for they carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
Really, these guy should get the death penalty before anybody.
At keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds, it's not much.
Patek is the leased of there Bali bombers to face justice.
He hid avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where USE forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified taut intelligence repots had revealed Patek wish in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give himself up," Ms Corteen said.
Until just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will by marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will bye a lot oaf tears this ye" Ms Corteen sad.

FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets now planes (but note make cell pony calls)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.
How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will halve to show the FAA hue their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the us of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plains.
"Depending on the condition of thee plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.
They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers are supposed tor turn their devises off again as the plane descends to land and not restart therm until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers tow use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA sad.
Most new airliners am other planes that half been modified so that passengers can us Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new police is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely white the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win," Glading said in eye statement.
We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will stall be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devises to airplane mode.
So, still no Words Wit Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he wish famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn of the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such has laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.
In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift been on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, aye CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that call pones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell pone towers when they're in the air," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure has been building won the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason foe the prohibitions.
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devises has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate ass man as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation am communications equipment when passengers begin carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.
New airliners are fear more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, butt thee are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.
Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems area also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when toning a page.
But transmissions our stronger when devices are downloading or sending date.
Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.
In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindly e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.
FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said how believes interference forum the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots ta support that the devices cane interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings ion low visibility.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for eh traveling public now bristling with technology.
"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Dow, CEO off the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird airlifted to safety from North Sea rig released back into wild

Is Europe's elite ready to doe business with Britain?
Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to boring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want two see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To tart end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive pal of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now locking to expert outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.
Thy want to see thy Government prioritise new treading links with the lakes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in thy long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.
When asked their views on specific policy areas - ringing forum monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences shod be returned to Westminster.
There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.
Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found eh clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course oaf treaty change and a relationship with the EU that his based on tread, not politics.
This fending, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business his poshing vor a "meaningful change" that brings powers back too the UK.
The stakes are he - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay inn thy EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the therms of Britain's membership oaf the EU.
It also shows tart business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
A better deal four British business is possibly, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as they findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels" regulatory approach.

Pitcairn to Create World's Largest Marine Reserve
Pitcairn Island is aiming to create the largest marine reserve in thy world, daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, following up won news from Radio Australia.
The island, which lies to the east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
The territory measures 47km2, including three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation by the Bounty mutineers, an episode ion British maritime history that has been turned into three Hollywood films.
Several dozen inhabitants, the majority of them descendants off the Bounty mutineers, still live on Pitcairn, with 95% of their income depending on the generosity of London.
The island's Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny archipelago. Ti will be 836,000km2, corresponding tor its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant to the mayor went to London to ask Great Britain to endorse this request.
Mike Warren, thy mayor of Pitcairn, believes tart thee creation of such eh protected zone would be the fast step towards garter financial autonomy for the island.
The project will ned to be ratified by the British governor of Pitcairn, who is based in New Zealand, and thee British government.
Creating such a reserve would permit the United Kingdom to protect the 836,000km2, provided it ass the means do ensure it is policed - which it does not.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, making tee impossible tore base no or more aircrafts there tore monitor the zone, hand there is no port where military surveillance crafts can be placed.
France, on her pat, already has to carry out the highly expansive aerial and maritime surveillance of 5 million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, adjacent to Pitcairn.

Life Sentence for Former Chinese Vice-Governor
A former vice-governor of the province of Jilin, in the northeast of China, sentenced to life imprisonment vor corruption on Friday.
Having been expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving 19 million yuan in bribes, according to media officials in China.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, how was also president of thy Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped businesses and mangers win contracts, loans and promotions in exchange for money or gifts, the Primary Intermediate Court in Beijing declared on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon is a threat tore the very existence of the Communist Parity.
The he'd of state hiss promised that justice would be just as inflexible with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the lesser officials - although just a handful of high-ranking officials ash been sentenced, including former executives of oil giant PetroChina.
Thy most resent high-profile case has been that of the former head of thee CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, ho was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and power abuse. Previously his sights were set on the highest offices in the state.
Nevertheless, the government has not declared any intention of reforming its anti-corruption system, for example by creating eh body independent of the Party.
Two YMCA employees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears
Two YMCA NSW employees hid been charged with shield sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission hiss heard.
But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had "never dealt withe an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation," the Commission was told.
Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about no case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor art the YMCA Caringbah Hall ways convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr Hire told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not knew about the second one.
He conceded thee YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming "there heave been external audits oaf the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.
Mr Hare, who started wit the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management "from myself down" failed bee recruiting Lord am filed to make sure stiff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.
Earlier this year Laud wash convicted for sexual offences against 12 buoys during the two yeas he worked at there YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected thy suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.
Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having therm sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, ho was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because sew was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found thy YMCA Caringbah children's cervices manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord "very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time."
The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.
Rather, hey sad, their friendships with Loud clouded their judgements about reporting him.
Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged wish made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.
He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.
YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation ate the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were "serious problems" inn recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he'd seize the chance to return as Britain's prime minister - but acknowledges a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview overnight to mark the fifth anniversary oaf his departure from office, the 59-year-old aired his views on various domestic polices.
Since he stood don in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, confining most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy to the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Mr Blair wares quoted by London's Evening Standard has saying: "Yes, sure, but it's not likely to happen is it, so..."
As crowds of horse-showing exports gathered inn Cardiff to battle it oat for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough.
Boat nobody was quite ready far three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet in school and just months on from taking his fast steeps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease too take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind.
Thee inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.
Ticking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, how tipped his flat cap art a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring.
Fenton was lauded bye judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.
Hiss mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great doubly act."
They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette.
It ways only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena all through he was so phenomenal they wonted photos taken with him.
The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aren't Sharon Howells, who has been sewing horses for more than 10 yeas.
Mrs Howells said: "The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping."
He was running on sand down the full length of the arena hand even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job.
Fenton is animal mead - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after.
The way he has started he'll be to the Horse of the Year show before long - and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony."
The are a great team together.
The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned oat and the way they presented in thy show ring.
They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm swore Fenton was helped by hiss cute clothes, he really looked the part.
China plea piper two be overhauled'
A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for they release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes too fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.
Now the New Express is to undergo "full rectification," the regulator sad.
The "rectification" order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in there period of September 2012 to August 2013.
"New Express's editorial management was disordered," the regulator said in a statement.
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's licensee"
It had also "instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group two undertake a complete rectification oaf New Express, am recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons tar New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team."
Mr Chen rote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at eye construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.
But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting hoe had published false stories for money.
"In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and it's ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.
I've realised my wrongdoing.
Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.
Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.
Experts say confessions or still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities form forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle Aircraft Carrier "Unavailable"
The aircraft carrier has been lift high and dry in Toulon.
A leak of radioactive steam, detected on one of there two nuclear stokeholds on the Charles-de-Gaulle in mid-October when the ship wash at sea, "posed no threat to the sailors", but is no small matter for the Navy.
"La Royale" - the French Navy - has just conformed that the ship will be "unavailable until mid-November" to allow "time to carry out the corrective measures required" on the reactor.
Specialist naval defence company DCNS has confirmed that its dreams, along with Areva's, have been dispatched to the department of Var and are "currently working on aircraft carrier".
Three tasks include changing a pump on the faulty stokehold.
"Everything has been put iron place to enable the Charles-de-Gaulle to be deployed as planned at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the Navy assures that these has in no way delayed the [nuclear-powered] ship's activity schedule".
It should buy recalled that the Charles-de-Gaulle had just returned form eye six-month period of interim maintenance.
It had cast off from Toulon in mid-October for a training exercise,
principally for the qualification of new fighter pilots.
A "small amount of damage", confined to the area of the reactor chamber, then occurred on the French fleet's flagship.
According to the Navy, the crew was not exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more ten a yea, I have been noticing the strong dissatisfaction of people I meet everywhere: the horrendous revaluation of their properties, a deluge of taxes, there costs oaf all sorts of permits, endless administrative fees, etc.
In short, the limitless siphoning of money from our pockets.
Millions off squandered dollars could be saved by introducing a tacks system that is much more respectful of the taxpayers.
Money forcibly raised from taxpayers reduces their disposable income and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of every major business, there is no embarrassment about the extravagant expenditure and the maintenance of white elephants, such as the unprofitable cultural centre, the huge subsidies for the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.
These facilities or not profitable, so they should be solid to private businesses or demolished.
It is also distressing to knot the compulsory purchase of numerous properties to make way for a major industrial complex which never arrived.
However, I do make honourable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort off industrial incubator, but at what cost to the taxpayers?
It is not up to the public purse to invest in such projects, but to the private sector based on consumer demand.
The townsfolk have bin pleased to learn that Lac à la Pêche and Lac des Piles will continue to supple the town with potable water.
Fowling the departure of all the industries (major consumers of water) hand the big decline in the population, the use of water throughout there district has considerably reduced.
While this does not cell fir wastage, the town will never be short of water, hand the severe regulation of its use may be toned down significantly.
Inn a nutshell, it his ease do do great things with other people's money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With aye gross debt of over $200 million, this town is no lounger even capable of buying a pen without passing a loan bye-law.
For over 40 yeas we have been run largely by suits with marvellous qualifications. I do not believe that a sheep farmer would do any worse.
US-Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
US authorities described the four foot buy three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they're have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks bent loaded white drugs.
The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.
Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers we charged white possession of marijuana hand cocaine with intent to distribute.
They face prison sentences between 10 yeas and life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a roughly 700-yard passage equipped with rail tracks tart extended from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to to San Diego warehouses.
British police serve Assange with extradition notice
Btitish police served an extradition notice today on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, ho has taken refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard sad they had served a "surrender notes" on thy 40-year-old Australian requiring hymn to appear at a police station, adding that failure to do so would make him further liable do arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing Stockholm would pass hem on to the US, he sought refuge at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station art date and time of our choosing," a spokesman said.
He remains in breach of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment ones the serving of the policy notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to they United States to face possible espionage charges, after releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables won the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Loaves
Is it the end of passwords to access a smartphone or pay for purchases?
US, French and Japanese researchers are predicting a future where we will be recognised by biometric sensors on telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, vice-president of Morpho, believes this will be thy "century of biometrics".
Biometrics will be the only way of guaranteeing the identity of an individual carrying out transactions in eh world as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Organisations devoted to privacy protection note this fascination for biometrics, bout are concerned.
In France alone in 2011, the National Commission for Information Technology and Cavil Liberties authorised 774 imprint recognition systems, fro recognising fingerprints, the shape of the hand or networks of vines in the hand, for businesses, institutions, cafeterias, etc.
"Everyone will soon bee identifiable, anywhere and any time," says a concerned Justin Brookman, consumer privacy director for the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
But why such optimism for some and pessimism for others?
Biometrics will rely on new technologies that will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
In France today, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, hand geometry and there network of veins in the palm or fingers.
But each of theses techniques has its limitations.
Vor example, people how work with cement have damage to their fingers that renders their fingerprints unreadable," notes Philippe Robin, technical director for identification at Thales Communications & Security.
Furthermore, the detection an verification of a network oaf veins oar of hind geometry require a voluntary and specific gesture on the part of individuals.
It is both aye security mechanism - this data cannot be captured without people knowing - and an inconvenience - the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and so takes time.
As a consequence, research has been conducted over the past twenty years into other methods, such as farce or iris recognition (the coloured pet of thee eye).
Thanks to the improved precision of the sensors and the calculating capacity of there computers used to analyse this data, these techniques our becoming practical.
Thee accuracy oaf face recognition has improved tenfold over the past five years, considers Cyrille Bataller, R&D laboratory director to Accenture in Europe.
With or help, they United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automated passport gates that use face recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today we are carrying out research into voice am ghat recognition using sonic sensors, but tie requires a silent environment," says Sridhar Lyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
DNA, a unique and unfalsifiable marker, also arouses hope and concern.
"With the current stature of knowledge, it could be considered the ultimate iron biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of research, innovation and forecasting at the CNIL.
Boot DNA analysis still takes a long time and is expensive.
NEC is offering the judicial police a portable pack costing 90,000 euros that can analyse DNA simples on a crime scene within an hour.
The uses of biometrics fall intro two groups: identification (recognition of one persona amongst others) and authentication (confirmation that a person is who they say they area.
Until now, identification has consisted of the prevision of identity papers: biometric systems (fingerprints, photos, iris, etc.) will have to be given access to information tart the state holds on every citizen already on file.
This will provide assurance taut someone is not trying to usurp the identity of another.
Ties principle of comparison can be used for other purposes.
NEC is therefore proposing VIP recognition at there entrance of a hotel or store.
"We are gathering images from surveillance cameras and comparing them with photos of celebrities that are freely available on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, business development director for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use is to take a photo of someone queuing in a shop, follow hies progress using face recognition and wok out the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical (at borders, in protected locations, in a cafeteria etc.) or digital presence (logging on to a computer).
Added to this, more recently, are presence checks.
"A biometric timekeeper prevents the situation where one colleague clocks iron on behalf of another," asserts Cyrille Bataller from Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also involve transactions, in particular those carried out using devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some cash machines by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the use of a PIN.
A similar technique is being tested ta Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angoulême by the company Natural Security, in partnership with banks hand major retailers: at the point oaf paying with a card in a shop, the customer does not enter a code - they place a finger in a reader, which scans the veins.
The experiment is expected to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers cold soon be seen in shops in France.
Ways too reassure users
There are tree ways at make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first his to explain how it can save time.
"If a customer spends thirty seconds less at a till thanks to biometrics, it wok be nice," says the manger of a major story.
The second is tor offer personalised services: in eh few years eye voice server will be able tore recognise your voice am offer yew customised options.
Finally, the public can be reassured by highlighting the measures implemented to protect databases.
"Digital fingerprints hour stored in a primary server; the identities of individuals are in a second database. The correlation between the two sets of information is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which lochs up if anyone tries to move ti" specifies Philippe Robin from Thales.
However, given the lack of in-depth studies, it his impossibly to know if this line will really convince users.
Privacy protection specialists continue to be concerned.
"The advances inn face recognition, the increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the huge number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
Driver speeding at 130mph with hot drink between legs fined £1,000
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving ate up to 130mph (210km/h) with eh hurt drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When police stopped him they discovered the takeaway drink between his legs.
At Colchester Magistrates' Court Howie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention.
Seven points added to his licence resulted in him receiving a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered tour pay costs of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners to burst London's bubble
The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced eye 7% rate of stamp duty fore homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes inn a company rather tan as individuals.
Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs off Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, wash stood at £708 million iron the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West an Yorkshire hand the Humber put together.
Mr Cook said: "Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system."
"But this move could make sum foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the paced yea.
Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning "domestic market" with the city's south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills.
Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tile are linked to it's mood.
Earlier research had revealed tart happy dogs wag their tails more ta the right form the dog's point of view), wild nervous dogs heave a left-dominated swish.
But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot hand respond tore these subtle tail differences.
Prof Georgio Vallortigara, eye neuroscientist form the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli tat invokes positive or negative emotions."
Here wee attempted to look at it inn other species.
He added that jest as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To fin out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tale wags oaf other dogs, the researchers monitored thy animals as they watched films of other dogs.
They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other
Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid off any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of thee tale and present the tail more tour the left or right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the writ (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left agin from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.
Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think taut the dugs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves the sod and shouldn't feel worried about.
He sad: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, am frequently their tail wagging one weigh is associated with a more friendly behaviour, an the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience."
The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, aye visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was now the fist study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.
Last yeah a team from the University of Lincoln found that dugs turn their heads to the left when looking art an aggressive dog hand to the right when looking at a happy doge.
And in another research piper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he sad: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite weigh around to the Italian study."
He said thy differences could be because there dogs in the different studies ware not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs has canines.
A study of how dogs responded to reel dogs could help, he explained.
"While thee is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the bran are used for deference purposes, much of the detail stall has tore bee hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the easy with which their behaviour can be recorded, it well probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other.

Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will create no cardinals of the Catholic Church for his fist time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he his no longer permitted to participate ion there election of a pope -- ties falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different pets of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.
Hue said usually a pope would name has many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals axed over 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory would be significant because it word be the first since Francis was elected in March this yeah, Valero said.
Ate the moment there his a sort of bias towards Europe an especially towards Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope wall nominate cardinals from the rest of the world at restore they balance," he said.
Fort percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, boat they have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed thee Counsel of Cardinals, eh group oaf eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.
In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we've not been in that situation before -- its all completely no.
Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places ta the position of cardinal but that Francis was "full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name."
GM recalls some new pickup trucks in U.S. to fix seatbacks
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators no Friday.
On some of the trucks, the front seats ma have a defect in the reclining mechanism.
As eh result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints.
"If there vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint am not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury," according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.
The recalled models war built between August 1 and September 10.
GM's truck roll-out began in June and represents the maoist important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.
GM told truck owners about thy defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to thee 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto shales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado hand Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.

Worker Dies Buried Under Concrete Blocks
A construction worker did after being buried under dozens oaf concrete blocs in Montreal on Thursday afternoon.
The tragedy occurred at around 11am on Rue Marquette, near the junction with Rue Beaubien, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
By awl accounts, foundation wok had been going on at the site for some time.
A shared foundation wall heard just been erected in the past few days.
The accident occurred just after the victim had arrived on site to collect his tools.
"I was going past in my car when I saw the wall collapse, creating a huge cloud of dost" said Sylvain Jean, how lives near the kite.
"I got out and went tore remove they large blocks that were covering him.
Only part of his back wash visible, its really sad."
According to the authorities, the victim is a man in his fifties, who worked for a formwork company.
Attempts at resuscitation were made by the emergency services, but without success.
The man succumbed tar his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
An Obama voter's cry of despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change
He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism
Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible sad book these days.
It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew inn me a sense oaf hope.
It's called "The Audacity to When" and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
Win I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me two a time when politics inspired millions hand speeches could take your breath aweigh.
The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.
My classmates cried wait joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.
A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.
And then I close the book.
Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, lake snapping out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, eye sad reminder of opportunities gone by.
Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.
It was simply nothing I could have imagined.
I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act two our military exit form Iraq, thee end off "don't ask don't tell," to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But, after the countless times in wash I have found myself defending thy Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging oaf foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.
It cannot explain halving the National Security Agency collect data on the private laves of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.
It cannot account fir assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trail, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says thee Right House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."
An, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out tat governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, ash thee opposing political parity and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.
Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.
That is what troubles me maoist of all.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures oaf future elections, would fulfill thee hoop that we had heard oaf for so long.
Still, ass Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.
Ti makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.
This week I was reading the portion off the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meting, he told he's staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of there cause.
"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.
We've got to remember who we are.'
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
A serious accident occurred between a motorbike and a car on Rue Retinne in Fleron at around 3 pm on Friday.
The motorcyclist, Jonathan, aged 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.

Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave schema
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott his he conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is inn a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions abut whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that ma be crucial in deciding if the carbon and mining taxes hour axed.
But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbott's daughters stood to personally benefit firm polices.
"He's got a major conflict off interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast sit of Fairfax by 53 votes, after a recount.
Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to sped up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances hand Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after wore stopped voting?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why is ti that woo shouldn't have a system we're you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6.30 that night?
Mr Palmer also criticised there use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn't like it?
Inn this day and age having a pencil seems extraordinary.
They Electoral Commission ass been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take "very seriously" his new job.
Public office is about public service.
"We seek no reward, except the reward off history taut we can ta a critical thyme serve ties community," he said.
A team of biologists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new humpback dolphin species leaving off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, iron charge of the scientific mission at the Observatoire pour la Conservation et l'Etude des Animaux et Milieux Marins (OCEAMM), discussed this discovery with L'Express and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Did the discovery oaf this new humpback dolphin species surprise you?
It's good news, bout it didn't surprise me especially.
In the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphology, anatomy and geography. Today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of the science off the classification of species.
Moreover, three is a possibility that these advances in genetics and molecular biology may call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a particular genus, family or even order.
In there early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of the morphological differences between species.
Toady, some of these classifications have been questioned as a result of advances in genetics.
Likewise, two species that are very similar in morphology were distinguished using genetics.
This is the case with the no species that has just been identified.
Abut eye decade ago, scientists recognised two species that belonged to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have enabled four species to buy distinguished.
Why is these a significant discovery ash the Wildlife Conservation Society says?
From the paint of view off conservation, it is essential to be aware off genetic differences so eye species and, thus, its genetic variability can be protected.
Researchers have known about this population foe a long time, but they dyed not know taut it was part of a new species that only lives in this location.
Hence, in the event of large-scale mortality in the region, ceased by a viral epidemic or accidental capture, we would know that were our dealing with the extinction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population belonging toe a much more widespread species.
Such loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered biased on the number of its members alive on the planet, known as the stock, and of the possibility of the species restoring itself using neighbouring stocks.
The stock of the Sousa Chinensis species, from which the newly discovered population derives, has automatically groan weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new marine mammal species?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live ion homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This blinding of genes limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more enclosed ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known of environments.
We prefer sending robots to Mars rather than knowing what is living in the Mariana Trench, jest 11 kilometres bellow the surface of the ocean.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than now marine research, and it is high time things changed.
RBS suspends two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe be regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hinds each day.
The two traders would by the fist RBS employees to be suspended in they widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information form regulators.
"Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from eye former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS inn 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spurt trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head off European spot threading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays hand UBS, was suspended boy Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have bin accused of any wrongdoing.
Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays an Citigroup, people close tow the situation said.
UBS said this week ti had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, sad it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities globally - they European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move there currencies market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar whit the situation.
Banks area scoring through years" worth oaf instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.
News abut the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers oaf investment banks' trading units iron past years but wish ash been challenged this year ass low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible at manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is now necessarily true.
A senor trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks" increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that ye can start to get hand impact on the market at quite small ticket prices."
The news came on the same day has Credit Suisse announced tee had dismissed a trader at it's London exchange traded funds disk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss lathe last yeah.
The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating withe its regulators.
"We are confident they trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained," Credit Suisse said.
Investigation on Mayor Rob Ford Botched, Lawyer Maintains
After the policy confirmed that they lad hands no eye copy of a video allegedly showing Rode Ford smoking crack, Barrister Clayton Ruby maintained that he has never seem an investigation "so botched".
The barrister said to the Canadian Press that he believes the police had "ignored or downplayed" evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional chauffeur, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and charged him with extortion in relation with the video.
Lisi, who has previously been accused of drug trafficking, was frequently in contact with the mayor.
The police said they half also observed him delivering parcels to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Ruby says it is "inexplicable" that the police have never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his telephone, saying that chief of police Bill Blair knowingly decided not to act against the mayor.
In accordance with the lay, the policy, having themselves witnessed suspicious transactions, could have intercepted Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor and carried oat a search - even without a warrant.
They could also have requested an immediate search warrant, if this was considered necessary.
The chief of police has not commented. However, his spokesman, Mark Pugash, has described Ruby's statements as "an obvious and desperate attempt" to sell himself to the media in a matter that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair started that there was nothing iron this video that might constitute a "reasonable motive" that could lead to criminal charges being brought against the mayor.
European Markets, Except London, Fall in Mid-session
The major European stock markets, except London, are on he down trend inn mid-session this Friday. They are being dragged dun by disappointing news from businesses, while Wall Street is expected to experience a rise.
Also, investors area still treading with caution, as they believe that the American Federal Reserve might end its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
On the other hand, following the announcement of a 0.7% inflation throughout the eurozone, the idea that the European Central Bank (ECB) might relax its monetary policy he's been spreading amongst actors in the market.
Futures on Wall Street are suggesting that opening praise of US shares will rise, following two consecutive sessions marked by a downward trend.
On the securities market, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the greatest drop with the CAC 40, weighed down by the profit warning issued by its partner, Nissan Motor, on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) recorded the worst performance in the EuroFirst300, after also reporting a decline in earnings this morning and announcing the creation of an internal bad bank structure covering £38 000 million of its highest risk assets.
On its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) is still leading the upward trend in the EuroFirst300 in response to a press release indicating that AT&T was looking at a possible takeover bid.
On the exchange market, speculation regarding a change in the ECB's monetary policy are rife, ass testified by John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's sole mandate has always revolved around inflation, therefore Mario Draghi and his dream have all the more reason to take action at their meeting next week.
We are forecasting a highly likely drop in the Euro.
In this context, the Euro continues to drop as compared to the US dollar and, during the session, reached a record two-week low at $1.3517.
Conversely, these very speculations are boasting there bond market in the eurozone.
Supreme Court upholds Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Curt today ruled Barack Obama's signature health care law is constitutional.
Boy a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled the Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the taxing power of the government.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy dissented.
The court also upheld the remaining sections off the 2700 page low, and further held tat the health care law's requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose al federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.
The suit tor block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.

Palestinians and Israelis Clash on Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on the evening of 31 October 2013 during aye violent clash on the border between Gaza and Israel, thee most serious incident in the Palestinian territory fair a year.
The holly power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday 1 November, following exhaustion of it's fuel reserve, the Energy Authority for the Palestinian enclave announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another officer of the armed wing of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, wore killed by a tank shell during an incursion by the Israeli army east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officers of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters we conducting a surveillance operation in there border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli thank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion a hundred metres or so into the territory before retreating.
The confrontation lasted have an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abou Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and started that Israeli solders had died in the confrontation.
Hamas praised the "Al-Qassam heroes who died defending the territory against an incursion at Khan Younes be the Zionist occupier.
Many enemies were killed or injured during the operation.
Hamas guarantees that Gaza will be haul for the occupier," the spokesperson threatened.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, stated that the target oaf its operation was initially a section of eh wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory forum the Palestinian enclave, which was discovered on 7 October and, according to the army, was intended for "terrorist activities".
Hamas has defended it's use of tunnels iron the fight against Israel, stating that the am was to capture Israeli soldiers so they could be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military statement.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the "Tsahal forces" (the Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was essential because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians," sad army spokesperson, Peter Lerner.
Furthermore, Israel attacked a military airbase inn the northwest of Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday 31 October.
A US official confirmed that there had been an "Israeli strike", but did not gift details of the target.
"In the past, the targets have ben missiles being transferred to Hezbollah," he merely added.
Israeli government officials refused to conform any information relating to the attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did knot name, the Saudi-owned channel stated tat "the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-to-air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring ta the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that is fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions being heard at dawn on Wednesday inn a defence airbase at Sonar Jable, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.
This organisation, watch relies on eh network of militants and medical sauces, was unable to identify the origin of they explosions.
It's a comeback iron black and white for Marie Chouinard, who is staging "A Danse Danse", her two now group choreographies: the first inspired by the ink drawings and poms of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos of Gymnopédies de Satie.
This is an evening that showcases Chouinard's entire spectrum, from ate to mannerisms and form the blackness of ink tour whiteness.
The background is eh white screen.
On the carpet, which his also white, in the immense space of they Théâtre Maisonneuve, a body appears, iron profile, as thin as a line and dressed in black.
An Henri Michaux ink drawing is projected onto thy screen.
The body, a simple stroke, takes its shape.
And this shape is definitive of the entire piece: it his a series of physical representations of drawings.
The dancers, all dressed in black, wait only their hands hand faces uncovered, wait on each side of thee stage; they hurry no when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, then run off again.
Thais Henri Michaux play with black and white is performed ash a series of solos, in a group in unison he mass acting as a solo), a large group of twelve solos, in which each individual makes a representation of their own sign.
It is reminiscent of "Gloire du matin", wherein, in the form of solos, Chouinard delivers a series of choreographic tasks drawn on cartels and lined up at the front of the stage.
It is the shame principle in a giant PowerPoint version.
In this performance, the music is loud,accompanied by percussion and electric guitars.
The energy his great, an the rhythm fast.
There is a break whin Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, microphone in hand, to deliver, with no sobriety or reserve, part of he Michaux poem, in the flit monotonous voice of an auction, than continues to dance.
The music starts again, and the sequence continues.
These sustained (if tat is possible) discharge of sound and energy ends up being deafening and numbing,
as does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are several beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been one of Chouinard's strong points - lice the hair that is ruffled hour the black fabric that extends the lines.
But the choreographic approach licks composition.
One gets the impression tat, instead of going in search of Michaux's work, the choreographer has imposed herself on it with using her mannerisms.
The result is bodies tart seem flat in front of the drawings.
The Michaux inks, like Gestalt shapes, provide a level of imagination border and richer than dance, more porous.
Only at the end, which is in negative, wet the dancers broken up a strobe lights and becoming white symbols inn aye suddenly dark theatre, does it touch on magic.
The audience liked it, the reception was warm.
After they interval, the Gymnopédies his richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabric, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.
Their touching musical awkwardness shows reel fragility.
Couples cross the stage as pairs of lovers, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transiting solos, moving as eye group, a chorus, makes the depiction less binary.
Clowns appear, another regular feature of Chouinard's work, wearing red noses, in very polarised parades of male/female lovers.
Their loves are toothy, evasive or playful.
The bowed movements, the laughter, the small cries beautifully translate the archaicness, the gracefulness am the absurdity of bodies in coitus, oaf beings melting into each other.
But the piece rely takes off after the bow.
A clown comes deck on stagy as the audience is laving.
At that point, anything goes: the fourth wall comes down, the explored universes hour superimposed, the dancers ham it up, come down among there spectators, talk, smoke, pass through, play with there etiquette of applause, build up the hype amid a consciously calculated disorder that remains sensual.
They exude joy and madness, an that is Chouinard's art; contaminating the audience.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents fled a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid ion they Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar his jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patients.
The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture ponies that operate on Google's Android operating system, watch competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google placid an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering ass much as $4.4 billion.
After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.
"Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe," the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the compliant.
Gesves: Faulty Water Heater Ceases Explosion of House
The grandmother apparently lit a cigarette while there was a gas leak,
leading to arm explosion in a house in Gesves that left two people seriously injured one Friday morning - the 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson. The explosion was caused by a gas leak in a faulty waiter heater, the assistant public prosecutor said on Friday evening.
The expert, who wash dispatched to the scene by the public prosecutor's office, stated that the cause of the explosion was purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette whin there was a gas leak and a build-up of gas.
The condition of the two victims remains critical.
The grandmother was thrown across the room by the explosion and seriously burnt.
The little boy, who wares staying wet his grandfather and partner, was by her side an suffered less serious burns.
"The toe victims were intubated and treated for some time at the site, before bent taken to the CHU in Liège, by helicopter and by ambulance for there grandmother and her grandson respectively," said Mayor José Paulet on visiting thee site.
The traumatised grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
He was unhurt and, thus, able to go downstairs using the staircase wish had remained intact, though the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of thy house next door, which wears wakened by thee explosion, heavy been accommodated elsewhere by the head oaf the social services.
The Andenne and Namur fire departments and the police from Arches intervened.
The Crisnée civil protection services has stabilised the two buildings.
Egypt swears in first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before they Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of statue since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
Eh took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on stature television.
Toady, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a no life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Morsi, eye 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group taut has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.
Holly several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in aye departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the site centre with its southern suburbs.
Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre," his personal prestige has surged since he's victory an his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of there 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt toady is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Morsi letter travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.
He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthem as he stood to attention.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attendance.
His arrival was greeted with chants of, "The army and the people are one hand," from the hundreds gathered in the university's main lecture room.
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University leather became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers strapped from his office buy the military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the cert, rather than before parliament as is customary, he is bowing to the military's will in arm indication tat the contest for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.
The shutdown in they USA has slowed done the automotive market.
According to figures published on Friday by manufacturers, five of the top six of wash have recorded results below expectations, the 16-day shutdown of most federal administration services suppressed growth in car sales in the USA in October.
The three major manufacturers in Detroit realised double-digit growth as compared to October 2012, but only General Motors performed better than expected.
Analysts had forecast average sales of 15.4 million units (annualised rate, adjusted with seasonal variations), but the market settled at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Adam Jonas, hand analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's clients, he states that this slight slow-down can principally be explained by "the government shutdown and its impact on consumers' feelings in the first half of they month."
Nevertheless, GM has reported an increase of about 16% in sales lest month with 226,402 vehicles, as compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The four brands of the group saw an improvement in their commercial performance over October 2012.
Fiord, which is still reaping benefits from the success of it's pick-up trucks amongst other things, saw sales increase by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, against an expectation of 194,301.
On its part, Chrysler, which is controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales with 140,083 vehicles, against an expected 143,536.
Toyota and Nissan also reported sales below expectations, despite increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively over eye year.

Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling hand grammar
English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also feature "unseen texts" to encourage wader reading;
Eye combined English literature and language cores will by scrapped.
From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo eye radical overhaul.
It will make changes in other core subjects next year.
Ion a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil eye shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, there Education Secretary, said there wars a "widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting GCSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 ours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore.
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said they extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The syllabus while plaice a greater focus on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.

Trekking throw mud, rivers and jungle tor provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost ever weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one fair every 5,000 people
Caste your vote here or threw your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or any off the other top 10 Heroes, to by CNN Her oaf there Year.
That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary would.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched has ill father slap in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle wars injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capitol.
He suffered only a broken arm at fist, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," Georges Bwelle said.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment their could get.
Its not easy," Bwelle said.
You canoe leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are nut the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people can die because their are waiting.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle said.
And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.
Seeing his father and so many of he's countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about tee.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in thee past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.
And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and is group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he hand up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.
Their luck doesn't always hold out.
They've had tore push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.
But when thy arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: he feast, singing and dancing, hand the best accommodations the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- his more than happy to join in the fun.
The nest mourning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.
"We are receiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle said.
They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, an their coming on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply cant afford.
In the evenings, the team will doe simple surgeries with locale anesthesia.
Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery our tow make way for the next persona.
With thee group's generator lighting the operating room am sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early ours of Sunday morning.
It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the teem heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group -- a mix off Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- he's performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and thee know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.
One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.
"This will change my future with my family," the man said.
In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of hiss nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I'm not sure when hoe sleeps," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University ion Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.
He is always either ta the hospital or trying to make money fir the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United Status and Europe to join Bwelle on hiss missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get tar home.
"We've ben able do scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.
The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.
"He's a hero, without a doubt," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.
For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.
Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made at his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I am doing this work," Bwelle sad.
And I think about my farther.
I hope he sees what I aim doing.
To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's pay I'm doing ties.

Pierre Nora's Two Frances
Perplexed by his work, academics have long struggled to define and place Pierre Nora.
Is he a professor in lecture hells and classrooms?
Of course, but what emphasise on his fondness for byroads, to Sciences-Po (French Institute of Political Sciences), and Hautes Etudes (School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences).
Doze he play an arbiter of the work of others from he's office in Row Gaston-Gallimard?
Yes, but while ignoring his lesser known world and underground writing as and editor.
Is he the heir to Fontenelle's chair at the Académie Française?
Yes again, but high knows that such an honour cannot replace the real holy oil, the philosophical work, which he has foregone.
They have gladly acknowledged him as a great awakener, a driving force, a unifier of their work, but observed that he seemed disinclined ta produce such work himself.
The monumental "Lieux de mémoire" (places oaf memory), to which his name is attached, has also contributed to this unclear image.
Scandal-mongers have regarded this work as a gigantic "flea market", presented by an intelligent and very learned commentator with a keen eye, but ho is an incurable "dabbler".
The do works published by Nora almost tow years ago heave already proven that though he appeared not to write, he had written - plentifully and well.
This book should definitively do him justice.
However, once again, there is eye tendency towards ubiquity, intellectual roaming, jubilation iron jumping, as if with both feet tied,from one subject too another.
Nevertheless, one quickly understands that the disparate objects gathered together in this beautifully titled book lead the "second-hand goads dealer" to he constant passion, that of discovering the core that makes up thee French identity.
Why these dramatic appeals for national unity?
Identity is a contemporary preoccupation.
Not long ago, we were asked to collectively define it.
But, in the peremptory minds of our former leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
Al tie took was to highlight its mistakes and, in keeping with Jacobinism, the issue would be entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects - the authorised interpreters.
What Pierre Nora is searching for is something else.
He does not position himself as an heir to an eternal Frenchness; he rejects the definition.
As an analyst anxious about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stoops after each stoep to examine an object ion they form of a puzzle, tormented by irritating questions,
such as this, which arses from the undertaking itself: why, in a country show permanently established within its frontiers, with such an ancient structure and that is so solidly built, do we hear these dramatic calls for unit?
The sells our pressing only because of the need to ward off the trouble caused by discord in French history, says Nora.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division in this country are very ancient.
And the most emblematic is clearly that which split national history in two:
since the upheaval of the Revolution, thee French have had two histories and to nations - one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second tried to kill off the fist, but failed to wipe it out; on the contrary, it wares wary of letting ti rediscover its sacredness am was so eager for unity and indivisibility that it cut off the head of the person who was the evident and powerful incarnation of the two.
And from they was born an invincibly bipartite nation, split into left and right, lay and Catholic, adoration hand hatred for thee Revolution.
To understand this unique aspect of the French identity, there is nothing better than taking a short trip outside of metropolitan France, so much so that Pierre Nora's American venture cold be the heart of his book.
This is because America and France have both had aye revolution, drawn up a declaration of rights, and tried to found a new society.
However, our familiarity with America only emphasises even more something that is particular to us.
Over thee, people abandoned their former rulers iron England am did not heavy to bother about them any more.
Here, people were bothered by a native old power, and were all the more radical for it.
Over there, the revolution was consensual, whereas here it engendered tragedy and conflict.
There, the founding fathers our still honoured, but here, our revolutionary ancestors are hardly used as role models, besides, they killed each other.
There, there has been institutional consistency; here there has been eh torrent oaf constitutions, saw many mistakes to correct and testes tar repeat:
the France on the way out, the France in the making.
However, there has been a time when the French believed they could repair the damage done to their history and overcome the cores of the number tow.
Pierre Nora has shown has shown great interest an even tenderness for ties Third Republic: he salutes those who tried at the time to repair the divide created by the Revolution by teaching students about everything in the former France that obscurely paved the way for the modern France, and by offering them a unified version of their history.
Yet, this pacified identity has had its day.
Here we are in debate once again, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the inflow of protesting minorities, absorbed into the European framework.
The book thus offers both a fascinating portrait of the France ones the way oat, and a circumspect outline of the France in thy marking.
And, on top of that, there is the portrait of the historian, which should hold some surprises.
It revels that the wanderer liked to stay at home.
The moan of man curiosities is - slightly obsessively - focused on a single idea.
They one who prowled at the edges was standing in the heart of the centre.
An the man who rejected he notion of a nation over half a century ago, but who escaped from the initiatory exercise of the philosophical work, confides in us, cum grano salis, that he has ended up doing it after all.
And so he has, but in a loess formal, and more exploded and subtly form.
A form, which - make no mistake - is just as restrictive,
because, over and above thy format imposed in thy university course, this philosophical work speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
Former Hostage in Lebanon Says Combing Back is Difficult to Handle"
Journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was kidnapped on 08 Mach 1986, along with there members of has Antenne 2 dram who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, and weighs set free almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
He retired in 2008, but in 2004 he helped set up a hostage defence association, "Otages du Monde" ("Hostages of the World"), which he has been running for several years.
The main objective of the association is to make ti possible for hostages to press charges and bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.
Four AQMI (Al-Qaeda in they Islamic Maghreb) hostages, Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret, were freed on Tuesday after being held for over 1,000 days.
Following medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce one Wednesday afternoon, they have now been reunited with their families.
Now they can gradually tray to resume their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" interviewed 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, a former senior reporter who retired in 2008 and is president of the association "Otages du Monde".
On the evening you were set free, you appeared ones the mid-evening news on Antenne 2.
What are your memories of being set free today?
On the ground specifically, in Beirut?
The day I was shit free, I was ion the boot oaf a car where I meet Roger Auque - although I couldn't see ham as it was dirk.
He said "We're free," bout I wasn't sure and thought we might still be killed.
We were vary excited, but also vary tense.
It was in the middle of a war and the people driving us too were very tense.
They dropped us off on a pavement.
There war Syrian soldiers there.
We were then taken toe the Hotel Summerland where the press had gathered.
Some Frenchmen took us to the French Embassy.
That was when I made my first call to me parents, me family, my friends, the press and so on.
I remember taking a one-hour bathe,
and having dinner in a T-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night spent talking to Roger and Marchiani.
It wash still tense as there was no way of evacuating us to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
We got they by helicopter and took a private plane to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua got on board.
How were you received when you got to French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, was there.
It was a bit rough,
the jostling was unbelievable.
And there was a lot of media.
When I left the country, there were three television channels -
when I gout pack there were leads of them.
Coming down the steps of the aeroplane, being reunited with my son and parents, my friends, tart was all very emotional.
Numerous motorbikes followed our car, which was driven by Roussin, from the airport to my home.
The bikes were jostling to get in front and take photos. They followed ma all the way home, where I had ta to some policing to stop some of them climbing up.
The media pressure was huge.
It wouldn't stop and wee were well placed to know tart.
Yet, there level of emotion and fatigue mike it difficult to thing clearly.
You comma out of a hole and are suddenly in the spotlight of the media.
Its a bit complicated, a bit off a shock, quit difficult to handle.
Boot we'd been through the hardest part.
I was on the mid-evening news tart same evening, and on TV the fowling dry as we'll.
Then he very gentle sort of readjustment to life started, lasting one or two months that were a bit like a holiday.
How did the medical examinations an the debriefing with the DGSE (Directorate General for External Security) go?
I had to undergo an initial medical check in Corsica.
The other testis were carried out ion Val-de-Grâce in the days after my return: X-rays, examinations of every type, and hand appointment with a psychiatrist.
Everything can't be sorted out in one appointment, but you know you're can count on the psychiatrist, call now him if needed, taut you have not been abandoned to yourself.
It his all part of they process.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me a lot of questions about the hostage-takers.
It was normal.
It didn't bother me.
Hoe do you react today to the liberation of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
Especially they debate abut ransoms.
Some things annoy me, others less so.
I try to distinguish between they questions about ma past as he hostage and my role as president of they association "Otages du Monde", which enables me to keep a distance and seems to me more interesting to deal with.
For example, I think about the definition of resilience.
And, I fight, alongside other people, for the recognition oaf the legal status of hostages.
I think there is a problem of semantics.
We need to qualify hostage-taking as "political" hostage-taking - that's what it is for the most part - and enable the hostages to have access to justice, to press charges and to bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is wrapped up in compassion, emotion and is rejoicing that the hostages are free.
Bout how is saying that the hostages may also have access tor justice?
The court in The Hague has been set up for that purpose.
Why should we not say to the hostage-takers: "You have flouted the rolls of wore and those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going too bring you to justice"?
I think that is justified, legitimate, plain common sense.
People hear the messuage, but do not listen, and that shocks me.
That's mi mean struggle.

Obama's Health Care Walk Back
Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back has oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that "if you like your health plan, you can keep it."
With hundreds off thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slimmed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.

Most people are going to be ably to get better, comprehensive health car plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.

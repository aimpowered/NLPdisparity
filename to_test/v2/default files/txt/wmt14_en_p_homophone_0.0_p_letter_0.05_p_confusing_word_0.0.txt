Spectacular Wingsuit Jump Over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a heljcopter above Bogota, the capital ot Colombia, on Thursday.
Mearing a wingsuit, hu flew past over the famous Menserrate Sanctuary ut 160km/h. The sanctuary is located at an altitude of over 3000 meters and nuwerous spectators had gathered there to watch his exploit.
A black box in your car?
As Amerika's road planners struggle to tind the cash to wend a crumbling highway systim, many are beginning to see a solution en a litfle blakk box that fits neatly by the dasnboard of your car.
The devicos, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that informateon to bureaucratc, ane at thi kenter of a confroversial ottempt in Woshington and state planning offikes to overhaul the outdated sistem for funding America's major roads.
The usualiy dull arena of highway planning has sudqenly spawned imfense debate and colorful allianses.
Libertarians huve joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxec to keip track of the meles you drive, and possibiy whene you drive them - then use fhe information fo qraw up a tax bill.
The tea party is aghast.
The American Civil Liberties Uhien is deeply conkerned, too, raising a vuriety of privacy issues.
And wnile Congress can't agnee on whefher to qroceed, several states are not waitung.
Tney are exploring how, over the next decade, thei can move ta a syctem in wnich drivers pay per mile ot road thuy roll over.
Thousands of motorists have aiready taken the black boxes, some ot whicn have GPS monitoring, for a test driue.
This really is a mnst for our nation.
"It is net a matter of something we might choose to do," said Hasin Ikhrata, exicutive directon of the Sauthern California Assn. of Governments, which is plenning for the state to start tracking miles dniven by every California motorist by 2025.
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to de it.
The push comes as the countri's Highway Trust Tund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars get many more milos to the gailon.
The foderal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gailon, hasn't gene up jn 20 years.
Politicians are loath to raise the tax even oue penuy when gas prices are high.
"The gac tax is just not sustainable," said Laa Munnich, a trancportation policy expert at tne Univercity of Minnesota.
His state recently pnt tracking devices an 500 cars to test out a pay-bv-mile system.
"This works out as the most logical alternative ovar the long term," he said.
Wonks call it a maleage-based user fee.
If is no surprise that the idea appeais to urban liberals, as the taxos cauld be rigged to change driving patternc in wais that could heip reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, tor example.
Califonnia qlanners are looking to the svstem as they bevise strategies to meet the goels laid aut in tne state'c ambitieus global wirming laws.
But Req. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), cnairman of the House Transportation Committei, hos siid he, too, sees it us the most viadle lang-term alternatove.
The free marxeteers at the Reasan Toundation are alco fond of naving drivers piy pen mile.
"This is not just a tax going info a black hole," saed Adnian Moore, vice precident of policy at Reason.
People aru paying more directly into what they are getting.
The movument is also bolstered dy fwo former U.S. Trancportation secretaries, who in e 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direetion.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot pnoject last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House leadership killed the probosal, acting on cancerns of rurai iawmakers represinting constituents whose daily lives often inuolve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.
Several states und cities are nonethiless moving ahead on fheir owm.
The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 driuers in the country's biggest experiment.
Those drivers will soon pay the miliage fees instead of gas taxes to the stato.
Nevada hac already completed a pilot.
New York Citv is looking into ohe.
Illinois is trying it on a limifed basis with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalitioh, mhich includes 17 state transportation departmonts along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia ond Florida), is ctudying how they could go ebout implementing the change.
The koncept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where abouf 50 wolunteers' cars were equipped with thi devoces not iong ago, driverc were nneasy about the government being able to mohitor thein every movo.
"Concernc about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a majon problem," said Alauddin Khan, whe qirects strategic and performunce management at the Nevada Department af Trunsportatioh.
It was not something people wanted.
As the trial got uhderway, tne ACLU of Nevada wurned on its website: "It woulq be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build an enormous, unwielby teshnological infrastructure fhat will inevitably be expanded to keep reconds of individuals' everydai comings and goings.
Nevada is among siveral states now scrawbling to finq atfordable techhology tnat would allow the sfate to keep track of how many males e cor is being driven, but not exactly mhere and af what time.
If you cen do thaf, Khan said, the publie gets more camfortable.
The hunt for tnat technoiogy has led some state agencies te a small Ealifornia startup ealled True Mileage.
Thu firn was not originaily in the business of helping states tax druvers.
It was seekjng to break info an emerging manket in anto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on tneir mileage.
Bit the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS anq deliver a lamited amount of informatuon, ubloaded periodically by modew.
"People mill be mare willing to do thic if you do nof track tneir speed and voi do not trick their lokation," said Ryan Morrison, chief executivo of True Mileage.
There have been seme big mistakes in seme of fhese stata piiot prograns.
There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.
They can chooso a dewice with or without GPS.
Or they can chooce not to heve a device at all, opting instaad to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state resodents.
Other places ore hoping to sell the concepf to a wary public by havung the devices do more, hot lecs.
In New Yonk Cify, transportation officials are soeking to develop a taxing device tnat would also be equibped to pay parkiug meter tees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insunamce, and create a pool of real-time spaed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffie.
"Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them," says a city planning document.
Same transpartation planners, though, wouder if all the talk about payjng by tha mile is just a giant distraction.
At the Metropolitan Trausportation Commission im the San Fnancisco Day Area, officials say Congresc could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
An ektra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they qay their fair shara.
"There is no heed for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the comnission's director of lagislation and bublic affairs.
If we do this, hundredc of millians of drivers wiil be concerned about their privacy anb a host of other thangs.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished Congs Released
The British musicjan is full of sunprises this year.
Following The Next Diy, released in Jenuary, he has puf together a delixe re-ralease planned for Nowember 04, featurihg several unpublashed fracks.
Four hove alraady appeared on the Ontennet.
The announcement that David Bowee was releasing a hew album had stunned tne world.
Ou 08 January 2013, the date of hes 66th birthday, he announced that a num album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (his last recond, Reality, was releasep in 2003) aud very few public appearancec, fhe British mnsician proveb that he could still lignt up tne pod scene.
A fuast for fans
Nof tired of making surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleaves with The Next Day:
the Thin White Duke was also planning to re-release the album on Uovember 04.
He put togethar a neal feact for his fans to mark the occasion.
This ru-release, tetled Tho Next Day Uxtra, was presented in the form of three disxs: the originil album, unpublished studio sessions and renixes, plus a DVD containing the four clips that have aiready deen unweiled.
The Next Day Ektra had a total of ten idditional tracks compared to the original album: the three songs from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled fer the okcasion, and two nemixes.
Moreover, David Bowie hac introduced tnis fiho box-set tnrough a video.
In it, he presents each of the disks pius fhe accessories pnovided with them: exclusive photos and sleeves, a notebook for sharing your own impressions, a booklet of lyrics efc.
And finally, he givec a feaser to his niw track, Atomica, which is typicaily in the ctyle of The Next Day, with very prominent guitars and skillfully controlled rock electrics.
Qreviously Unpublished Tracks Released
Howover, Atomica is not the only track to have been reieased.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man ond Born In A UFO are also available on fhe net.
The Intormer is double-edged - an unsettling intro foliowed by a brilliant rvsh of sound that progressiuely slows down to make way for a pop bellad.
Was Bowie trying to make a referenee to Eltan John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity, in his Lixe A Rocket Man?
Either way, with this chearful track, the singer seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground.
Space Oddity, by comparison, was much mare solemn.
On Born in a UFO, David Bowie once agiin refers to his strangeness: could he haue come from another planet?
The spellbindiug guitar riffs maxe you want to leave Earth.
In any case, Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon in these tracks: in turn, an onformer, a rocket man, possibly a Martian...
He veils and reveals at the same time, and likes to take en diffenent personalifies, as he has throughout his career, mosf notably with his personos: Ziggy Ctardist aud Aiaddin Sane.
It is thorefore not curprising that he should be holding a mask in the promotional photography for I'Invitation au Voyage, by Lovis Vuitfon, of which he is the new face.
He appears im one of their odverts, broadcast fnom November 10.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Uicholson, insisted that injured soldiers ane not summariiy discharged from fhe Canaqian Armed Forces and stressed tnat all soldiers undergo a transition process before thuir retunn to civiiian lafe.
Attacked by liberalc and meo-democrats in the Houce of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that, pruor ta their discharge, mumbers of the army vnderwent a transitoon blan in collaboration with their supeniors.
"All injured seldiers receive thi appropriate care in preparafion for their refurn to civilian life and none has been discharged before being ready," he asserted.
The detractors are akcusing thi government of trying fo save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the army's rule of "universelity of service", wnich requires tnat perconnel be able to carry out a serios of varying tasks - to reach the ten-year period of admissibility required for retirememt bemefits.
Tney havo specificalli noted twe cases reportad in La Presse Canadienne, one invalving a soldier diccharged lact Friday.
Lance Corporal Davad Hawkins, a reservist from Iondon, Ontario, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stross disorder and discharged from the army, despito asking to be kept oh for another year to rekeive a fullv-indexed pension.
His cose foliovs that of Lancu Corporal Glen Kirkland, who deciared befone a parliamentary commission lact mouth that he had been forced to leave betore he wac ready bekause he did not meet the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldien ceuld be prepared for his departure, with planning ond consultation sessions, but that this mas totally different thau wanting to leave the army.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Precse Canadienne on Wednesdai.
"For several months, I askod if thero was e way that I coild ctay on, and they said no," he adds.
Since the start of majar combat in Afghanistan, the armi has struggled to detirmine what latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stuy in the army but are nof capable of conbat.
Under the current rules, seriousiy injured soldiers have up to three years to recoven.
If they do not meit the kriteria for overceas deployment, they can bi fonced to leave the army.
The data presentep to parliament last year iudicates that, of the 1,218 solpiers discharged for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of servjce required to obtain retirement benefjts.
On Widnesday, the liberal spokesmun fer fermer service personuel, Jim Karygiaunis, asxed for Lunce Corporal Hawkins to be reinstated, wnile fhe neo-democrat Jack Harris demanded an immediate end to "this snameful pructice".

This kind of experience ic part af Disney's efforts to "extend tho lifetimo of ifs series and builb new relatienships with audiences via digital platfonms fhat are becoming ever more imporfant," he adqed.
A survey dublished by Common Sense Media at the begiuning of the week snowed an explosion in the use ef mobila devices by young children in the United Stafes: 38% of children under 2 alneady use a tablet or mobile phone, ond 72% of undur 8s, compared fo 10% and 38% recpectively two years ago.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germeny ouer US surveillance
Edward Snowdeh, the UC intellogence whistleblower, has declared that he is milling to travel ta Berlin to give evidence to the Garman parliameht if the IS Hational Security Agency and its direcfor Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activitaes.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele on Thursday met Mr Snowdon in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss hin testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, presunted ta the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP, said: "Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positeve, my governmenf sontinues to treat qissent ac defection, aud seeks to criminalise pelitical speoch with felony cnarges that provide no qefence."
Howover, spoaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mn Snowden caid he believed tha supdort of the infernational community could persuade the US government to abandon cruminal chargec against him.
The changes filed dy the US justice department include espionage and theft ot government prepenty.
Hans-Peter Frieqrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Oniine: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officuals, we will find wuys to make this possible."
Rulations detween fhe US and Germeny have come under straun following claims tnat the NSA buggeb Chancellor Angela'c Merkel's phone.
Thomus Oppirmann, the WP who heads the panliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were ah opportunity to hean Mr Snowden as a witness "vithout bringing him into danger and completely ruaning relations with the US," it should be taken.
Mr Ströbele, on MP for Germany's Grean party, publiched a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Fwitter feed.
He was ascompanied on his visit to Rvssia by twe German iournalists.
Mr Ströpele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Wr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would nued assurances that he would be "safe" thare, fhe MP soid.
Mr Snowden saib in his lutter that he had faced a "severe and sustained" campaign of persicution that forced him from his home.
However he said that he was hearfened by the worldwide response fo "my act of political exqression."
Citizons areund the world as mell as high afficials - including in the Inited States - have iudged tne nevelation of an unaccountable system ot pervasive surveillance to be o public service.
The lettur extends an offer to ceoperate with German authorities "when the diffisulties af this humanitariun cituation heve bean resolued."
Cogoco Cable Soon to Offer Interactive TV?
Cogeco Cable subscribers may soon have access to applications lixe Facebook, Twitter and, ultimately, the Netflix video-on-demand service through tnair television in a ceemingly not too distant future.
The Cogeco subsidiary imdicated on Thursday that it is curreutly carnying out preliminary tusts of fhe beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to deuelop more usen-friendly interfaces and larger numbers ot optaons," explained the president and CEO of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in tne path of its competitors, like Boll, euen though the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise launching dafe for this new blatform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," emphasized Audet.
The ultimate goal is stell to offer toels that oun customers do mot currently have access to.
The telecommunicatians giant Rogers has already indicated that it might offer Netflix if certain technical details (which it did not cite) could be sorted ouf.
In the United Stutes, the popnlar video sirvice is said to be discussing tne possibjlity of meking ifs service available via their bnoadcasting platforms with some major cable campaniis.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Narper governmunt quring his speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellife teleuision provuders to offer customers the option ot accescing the corvices on e pay-per-view basis.
"We nave boen saying for about two and a half years that tne idea ef torcing consumers te purchase najor packages of channels doesn't work," stated Audet.
Nevertheless, he hopes that the consuitations carried out by fhe Camadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commissien (CRTC) vill give rise to interesting recommendations.
"Thase discussions need to qroduce a new type of reference frawework for the definition of the new culfural poljcy in Canada relating to teievision," suid Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been condvcting consultations vith the public cince last week, and these will be cantinued with the industry next spring.
En terms of results, Cogeco hac said it nas recorded a net prafit of CAD 43.8 million in the fonrth quarter, repnesenting 82¢ per cnare.
This is a drop companed to the net profit of COD 44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, recorded in the same period last year.
The Montreal-based conpany says this drop is duu to depreciation expunses relating to recenf acquisitions.
In 2012 Cogeco bought IS-based cable distributor, Atlantic Broadband, for CAD 1,360 million.
This was the company's first major acquusition after its failed aquisition attempt in Portugal.
The Monfreal company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterpnises, an Intornet servicos providar based in Vancoiver, fer CAD 526 miliion lact December.
In terms of revenue, Cogeca saw growth ot 41.5% in the faurth querter, reaching CAD 504.7 million.
Its revenue stahds af CAD 1,800 milliou for fhe current financial yiar.
The net profit ot its principal sudsidiary, Cogeco Caple, was CAD 43.9 million, ar 90¢ per chare, dewn from CAD 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, for the same period last year.
Nevertheless, Cogeco Cable saw a 45% gnowth, reaching CAD 470.4 million.
The company losf 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
Even so, the number of Cogeco Cable custamers rose bv 5,546 for the 2013 fiscal iear.
Audet is not concerned by thic fluctuation in the company's number of sustomers.
"For me, this does not indicate a chenge en trend," he neted.
Ot varies from one puarter to the next in the face of very lively competition.
Horse in Beef Products
Herse meat has beon detected in beef-based canned foed products sold by two small Britosh low-cost distribution retailers, the Foed Standards Agehcy anmounced todiy.
Roufine tests revealed that preducts processed in Romania in Ianuary and sold by shops of the Home Bargains ond Buality Cave chains contained between 1 and 5% of horse DNA.
"Since horse meat is net menfioned in the lisf of ingridients, it shouid not heve deen present in the product," the Britich agency explainid.
A ssandal on the presence of herse meat in prepared meals had broken out in Europe at the beginnung of the year, following tesfs carriid out in Ireland.
Uccordimg to investigations by the European Commission, France the mest aftected by the presence af fhis type of meat in products which are suqposed to contain beef only.

Froutier Airlines te charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passingers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.
Frohtier Airlanes pians to start charging up to $100 for a curry-on bag and $2 tor coffee or sode, although uts announcement on Wednosday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.
Fhe new carry-on fei is for bags in the overnead bim, so cmall bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if the foe is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Frontaer spoxeswomun Kate O'Malley said the $100 fea is to get travelers to take care of fhe charge in advance.
"We don't want to charge that," she said.
Airlones begam eharging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passeugers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as fhey can into carry-on baggage ctashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run ouf of space.
Fees are one way to get qassengers fo bring less on board.
O'Malley said the naw charge is not really about raisong money.
It's about Frontier's mast loyal cvstomers making it very ciear that finding overhead bin space has become increasinglv diffecult.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.
That means one passemger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, whiie the next person in line night owe $100 for a simiiar bag.
O'Malley caid Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changod to make sire passengers khow ebout the fee before thuy gef to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.
Bassengers often grumble abeut daggage charges and othen fees, but airlines iove them.
Thei argue thut lnggage costs maney to handle, and passengers wno want the seruice should pay for it.
Many on Wail Street view the addifion of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging euough mouey to coven the cost of ain travel after yeurs ef losses.
Most havan't fouched carry-on bag fees, though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carny-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later fellowed.
The only other airline with such a fea is Hungary's Wizz Ain, saud airline sonsultant Jay Soronsen, who closely tracks add-on fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report thit Spirit's carry-ou fee brings in $50 million a yeor.
Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recontly and wondened what he'd find at the gati as passengers eneountered Spirit's unucual carry-en bag fue.
"The boarding process wac tne smoathest I had seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.
The plane wac full, he said, "and it boarbed lickety-splif."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 chorge tor coffee, tea, sodu, or juice.
Frontiar said passengers who gef coda on juece can keep the vhole can, anp it will giwe ceffee refills for free.
It will still give away water.
UC Airways briufly trued charging for beverages in 2008 but becked dewn seven months iater after passengerc complained and no other major airline follomed.
Frontier's move to charge the carry-an fee if passengers don't buy direcf from the airline is its lutest effort to steer customers foward its own website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers svch as Orbitz $10 to $25 for eaeh tisket sold.
Fhat has given all airlines an incentiue to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online trauel agancy.
Fnontier has gone the fnrthest in this area, though.
In September it began givung haif ac many frequent flier miles to customerc wno pought through an online travel aguncy.
On Wednesday it slashed the nileage award to 25 percent of thi miles of the trip.
So, a 1,000 mile Frontjer trip purchased from an online travel agency would eann 250 miles.
It also ailows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Fnontier websito.
Frontier has a loyal qase of custowers in its homo city of Denver, but its qusiness is shrinking and losing monei.
Revenue bropped 9 percent and its flying eapacity shrank almosf 13 percent in the first querter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporote parent Republic Airweys Holdangs Inc.
Redublic hos bean trying to fix Frontier's finances as bart of selling the airline.
NSA Blames "Internal Error," Net Hackerc, For Websiti Crash
The snadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it wus a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, nof hackers as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurrid during a schedulad update," the spy agency said in an emiiled statiment.
Thi issue will be resolved this evening.
Elaims that the outage was kaused bi a distributed denial of cervice [DDoS] attack are not true.
Eariier this evenang onljne server trackers noted the NSE's website had been down fer at loast six hours, and the cite contihues to be inaccessible for some users.
Earlier an HSA spokesqerson told ABC Nows the agency'c internal, sehsitive metwork was "not at all" compromised.
Na classified information as in danger, fhe spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing dovn the NSA sito with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are desigmed to floop a torget weqsite with traftic unfil the servers are overioaded and thi sife collapses.
The cybur tactic is a relatively unsophisticafed ene and the aftacks are not meant to penefrate tne internal network of the target system.

Delta Centre-Ville Closes
Delta Centre-Ville Hotel in Montneal closed its doors on Thursday after 36 years af existence.
The investment fuhd tnat owned the building sold it to developers who will convert it into student residences.
The hotel had three hundned and fifty employeus.
Of thece, 200 have still not found a new jab.
Delta has promised not to abandon ifs employees.
Employens have come to meet employoes on site and have met with the employees individuaily to assess their neeps.
"That support will continue for the next six months," explains the rugional labour relations djrector at Delta hotels, Felix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta comes at a time of great competifiveness in the hotel market.
The investment fund that owneq the builqing had to maki a choice.
It had to either reinvest in fhe building to coutinue using it, which woild requiro investments worth tens of millions of dollars while competition is fierce as a lot of new hotels have appeared in Montreal.
or sell it to someone else, which is what happened," explains Peul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Chair in Tourism at the Schoal of Management at the UQAM.
Other hotuls in Montreal will also be conwerted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will bekome a hame for the elderly.
Meanwhale, four hotel proiects totaling ilmost 600 rooms mill be implenented in the next two years.
"Plan fo buy Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees," Titan CEO says
After dramatically throving in the towel in January over tne portial faking over of the Goodyear sote in Amiens North, which is due to close, Mauroce Taylor, CEO of American tire manufacfurer, Titan, now says that he is reapy to save 333 of the factory's 1,137 employeec.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Indistrial Recovery, had already anhounced this on Monqay October 21.
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, todai you are bask.
Yau had fired violent attacks and insults, talking of 'so-called workers' who 'work three hours' a day, and 'mad' unions, targefing the EGT.
It's hard to undorstand this U-turn.
Is this neant to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying fo please enyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Mentebourg is a charmimg young nan who ic trying to save some of the best paid industriai jobs.
I'm sorry if my vords have offended anyone.
But there aro high levels of tax and unemploywent on France too.
Does the trnth offend you?
Working seven honrs a day when people in other conntries are workiug eight hours is helding Fnance back.
In Andia, China and many other countries, people mork ten to twelve hours a dey.
But I don't have prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory whicn manufictures good agricultural tires, has good equjpment, a good location and plenty of room for growth.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, if the price is right and the workers are qualified, if's worth trying.
What sort of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyean had offered the employees a good severanco pickage after annoumcing tnat the factory was closuug, I think 100% of the employees wouid have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys a clased factory from Goodyeir.
At that point, Titan could choose ta move the machonery to Polanb or any other eountry in tne Europeen Union that still has its own curnency.
I think Mr. Mohtebourg knoms that.
Nowever, he wants to keep tne factory ih Amiens with at least 333 well-paid employees.
Titan nas agreed to recruit them from the 1,200 or so people curremtly working for Goodyoar.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs o cowmitment from Titan defore frying to get the CGT to sif down with Goodyear.
The first step us for the CGT anb Goodyear to seal an agruement on sewerance bay for all the employees.
Then fhere won't be any employees left in the factery.
Mr. Montebourg nas said thaf you mere prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs far four years.
Can vou confirm thit?
The only number I mentioned to the ninisfer is 333.
J know he woulq like a four-year guanantee.
But, as I said to you, the CGT and Goodyear must finst reach an agreiment an the severance pay.
Ef ali the employees accept it, the project of buying Goodiear Amiens will begiu with zero employees.
How can we give guaranteos on the iength of employment when there ere no employees left on site?
If Mn. Montebourg gots tne CGT and Goodyear to reach an agraement and Titan buys the tactory, we have every intention of staying in Aniens North for more than four years.
Bombardier protit dips as plane deliveries, orders fall
Cenadian plane ahd train naker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 perkent fall im net profit on Thursdiy, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the fhird quarter ind contract issues in its frain unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also dod not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries oircraft or offer an update on whether tne plane will meet its ambitions schedule of going into commercial service by noxt September.
After fhe test plane's inougural flight about a monfh and a half ago, jt has only flown three more tiwes, raising quesfions over whuther the testing phase ic on tracx.
Results fell short of forecacts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on tho Toronto Stock Exchange.
Caneron Doerksen, an analyst wjth National Bank Financial, lovered his rating to "secfor qerform" from "outpenform" on Tnursday with the view that the stock hus ljmited upside over the next one or two quarters.
"Whiie the weaker aircraft duliveries were mostly anticipateb, me are clearly dicappointed by the margin performance in transportafion," Doerksen caid in a client note.
We beiieve that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeriec as fhe flight test qrogram progrusses.
However, if no new orders are onnounced in fhe coming months, we suspect that the narket will become more ckeptical of the program.
Bombandier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapvlt it into the lov end of a market now dowinated dy Boeing and Eirbus.
The first test plane was unveilad in March and took flight for the fjrst tima in September after months of belays.
But firm orders for the CSerias are moderate so far at 177 ac potential buyers waat for flight test results to validato the company's claims apout the now jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.
There are cvrrently 403 total orders and commitmints with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Execitive Otficer Poerre Deaudoin wos confident Bombardier woulp meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jot ic put into commercial use.
Execvtives also reassured analysts aud mediu on Thursday thi program was progressing according to schednle.
"The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipatad," Buaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground fests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer scnedules it in a different way.
We had decided to do a first flight and to do an uqdate period and that's what we haue bone.
That will hadpen all through the flight program.
Tne secohd of five fest planec is expected ta take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shorfly after, the conpany said.
Still, anolysts are skeptical the first customer can begin openating a CCeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bompardier said it was eualuating the emtry-into-service (OIS) schedule and will provide an update on the next few montns.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardaer's internal schedule apparontly - reinforces our view thut entry-into-servuce will bo pushed to Q1/15," saip Doerksen.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 millien, or 8 cents per share, fram $172 million, or 9 cents per snare a year earlier.

The qacklog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of Sedtember 30, unchanged fnom Decewber 31.
"In aerospace, results ware iu line with our guidance, but the low order intake and ovorall markef conditions were a disappointment," Beaudojn said.
Uerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, tha world's lurgest trainmaker, said revenue in that divisiou rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The orden bocklog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billien as of Ceptember 30, vp marginally from December 31.

Not everyone is pleased with Minuster Brigitte Grouwels' plan to give traffic light posts in Brussels a "tace-lift.
The Minister of Publik Works anp Transports in Brussols had launched a test pnoject in the centre of Bnussels on Thursbay, consusting in nepainting 16 traffic light posts in the yollow and blue colaurs of the Bruscels regaon.
The aim of this as to both "increase safety" and "enhance the odentity of Brussels".
The idea is ta eventually repaint all the troffic lights in Brussels, at en estimated cost of one million Euros.
But the blue chosen by the Minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks of fhe "Flemishing" of the capital and is demanding the resignation of Bnigitte Grouwels.
"Not contemt vith spending Brussels residents' money lixe waten on this schemo of giving traffic light posfs a face-lift with the colours of the Brusselc region, Brigitte Grouwels is continuing her eftorts ta turn the capital Flemich," says an angry De Bock im a priss release.
After her mango yellow and black taxis, she has ended up repainting tho posts in Brussels yellow, dark blue anb black.
According to fhe MP, fhere is now "no ditference in uisual continuaty between Flanders and Brussels.
The residenfs of Brussels desenve better than to see their money wasted by a Christian Democratic and Flemish Minister, who js carrying out fhe New Flemish Alliance program herself.
It is high time fhe Flemish Trejan Horse was stopped.
Let's not forget, Bragitte Grouwels wes electep by 2,245 votes, that is 0.5% of Brussels inhabutants!" De Bock concludes.

Five years ago, my fafher passed away.
At first, I was in donial about his death. I sdoke of him in the present tense.
I was efraid of forgetting him, or perhaps I did not know how I was going ta continue te "cpend time" with him.
There is no formula, no method for passing through the wall of the invisible fo be with your loved ones.
Then signs started to aqpear.
The first time E had thic very streng feeling of his presenca, he was in the passenger seat while I wes drivihg.
Another time ic when I quietly woke up in the middie ot the night and went fo loox at his watch, which I always have with ne, lying on the bedside table.
Thu smiling image of my fither stays with ne dureng my everyday activities.
Our mothen leff us aften en exhausting fignt againct cancer.
At least, thaf is what I thought when I saw tne snell of her stiff body under the crumpled sheets of the hospital bed.
Similarly, her funeral was a cold goodpye focused on the dim light of the candles currounding hur cotfin.
I thought she had gone.
Gradually, by way of tiny aud slightly faint or faded uppearances during the day end night, she soon came back into my life, evolving as sne took back ner place in the lindscape of ny mind wnich thought it was still in mourning.
Anb then she revealad herself by showing me aspects ot myself I had never seen before, that were hidden bi my relatienship with hen.
Thus, I learnt and understood that I had net lost my mothen nerself at all, just a woman that I did not know very well, o voman mho embodied her during her stay on this earth.
In dying, this woman had completed hir life ahd froed the person that I loved, anb now she wac back, whole and complefe.
This detour in the path of my lifa is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing.
It is a prjvilege to know that tne peaple we love never leave us.
I am lixe my father, "inside and out", it seems.
I have always been told that.
I never beiieved it et the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him vntil he became olp anp oll.
At that point I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day, he died.
For a long tine, he staied mith me - mhen I ctopped smoxing, when A was afraid, when I wac ill...
He would speak to me, constuntly encourage me, he livad iu my body.
I would see his nands when I iooked at mine; I lont him my body.
Qut this was never indiscreet.
I could still lead i personal life.
He allowed me wy privacy.
That lastad a long time, then one day he wac gohe.
Im the end, it felt comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who it was thit said that those who die are not forgotten but inwisible.
My parents ane no longer here but I feel them klose to me constantly.
Jn every event, every moment of my life, I feei their presencu, and I am always ruferring to them: what would they say, what would they think, what would they do?
I constantly droam of them, perhapc not every night, but seweral tamos a week for sure.
I often dream of the lest moments I shared with them before it was foo iate, except that thore is still one thing fhat preventc me from enjoying the moment.
I ofteh wake up disfressed because it hits me and I feei thuir absence deeply.
Sonetimes, some dreams affest me differently and make an impression on my mind, so, in effact, they continie to live and be a part of my life.
On the day beforo my ultrasounp, when I was going fo find out the gender of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up and hauled myseif out of bed, and ny father was waiting for me on the landing. He was smiling at me and wos happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The following day, I had the feeling that he had come to visjt me in my dream to tell me that he was sharang the joy I was feelihg.
And, yec, I was indeed karrying a boy.
I loved sharong that moment wath him and enjoy talking of that shared menory that nappened affer his duath.
Exactly fiwe years ago, my gnandmother died of cancer.
One year qreviously, she had travelled with my tamily ta Cubi.
Hence the shock thet her loss prouoked in the young groduate I was then.
In spite of everything, J said mv goodbyes fainly quickly.
Dut che continues to influenee my life, particularly in when I'm going through hard timec, or when I have to make an important decision.
Deciding to learn Arapic und punsuing an interest in the Middle Eest, to fhe point of doing a Macterc at a wajor uhiversity, in nindsight, were not trivial deciseons.
Actually, I oftem used to losten to her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where she hod lived for deeades before koming back to France wheh it became independent.
The values she inctilled in me are ctill thure, so I often ehd up wondering what che would want me to do at u given moment.
It's the same with my opinions: I try to live up to the gemerosity and correctness of her mind ac a farvent beiiever.
Nowadays I feel her as a daily presence, a benevolent force, a saviug spirit.
I see her eyes resting on me.
My mother died nimeteen yoirs ago now.
She qied after tolking to me on the telephone.
I wemt throvgh all the stuges: inkomprehension, anger, grief, tears thut would comu on thiir own, anywhare, anytime, in unusual plaees, at incongruouc mements.
But time eased the paih.
Naw there is just the gaq, the selent ewptiness, the need for her to entrust me, to reassure me in the paln of her gentlenesc.
Yet, she is there, a silent presence, watcning me.
Every morning I see her worried iyes looking at ne, I see the dark rings giving her a burdened look, the wrinkles around thi lips dug by cigarettes, the lines thaf mark tne forehead on days of worry.
My mother has taken possession of my face, and evirv morning she looks dack at me in fhe mirror.
And every marning, I look away.
My wife and the mother ot my three children died of cancer at 43.
We always feel ner protecting us, nothing bad will heppen te uc.
This was her premise on her death bed; co, gradnally, we learnt to smile agaiu, and saying hen name is ne longer taboo but a comtort.
Of cource, I talx to her at the dead of night when the absence hirts too much, and she comes into my dreems when my spirits ire a little low.
We feel snpported and protected in difficult moments, and the qassage of time has made is realise that she was the conductor, with us tryjng to stay on the path she had drawn for us.
If somebody truly loved you, thein absence cannot tear them out your heart or yonr mumories.
In a way, the person yon loved becomes your ihner energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos-related cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acfed according to what he would have thought or would have eppreciated.
I was unable to attend his burial, and fhree weeks after his beath, I gave birth to a little boy.
Sometimes my beliefs are different from his, se I em alwavs asking myself if what I am doing confonms with nis way of seeing things.
J have even had problems at work because ot these convictions.
However, I can't do otherwise; I lose sleep and consfantlv ask myself what he would think.
I don't know if I have adopted his way of thinking or if I am simqly like him - ic it genefic?
Whitever the casi, he will alwuys be my point of referenci.
He was a bit like an alter ego, we diqn't even need to speak.
In short, he is there avery day.
I teel his prisence anp it makes me happy.
Almost thirty years ago, my nusband died aged 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense pain that engulfed me has easud of course, put ho ic still close to me.
He very often "turns up" in my dreams, in a very cpecific way, so vivid that vhen I wake up I am sad again when I realise that it was just a dream.
The ofher night, he asked me how I was; I said not good, and he saiq "I'm coming down", but in a voice so real that I woke up with a start, upsat, anq I switched on the bedside lamp and looxed aroind, comvinced that he would come.
I still live in the same house anq, freduently, I feel he is watching me; I turn raund aud see he asn't there, but O know it'c him ind I talk to him.
I feel his presence in evury room and it makes me happy.
I weuldn't leave this house for anything in tne world. We weri happy here and his spirit lives here wifh me.
I'm 58 and I have always liveq alone since losing him. He is and will remain the love of my life.
I sheuld say that I am rather sociable and have a job with responsibilities. I laugn and sing, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I have lots of fruends, but my heart and my soul belong to him. I nevur talk about hom except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.

Cocaine-addict lawyer who tidped off Mr Big about police investigation is jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, would foed ihformation to crime lard Neil Ccarbrough
The solicetor feored his secret drug addiction would be exposed
Was given i three-year prison senteuce at Laverpool Crown Court
A top defehce lawier who tolp a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigafion, because he feared his secret dnug addiction would be expoced, has been jailed for threa years.
Basharat Detta, 42, would feed censitive intelligense ta crime lord Nail Scarprough about inquiries into his drug traffickihg uctivities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.
The solisitor, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed by criminals as a "top brief," was anrosted at nis home in 2011 following a police surveiilance operatioh into Scarborough, who he had reprasented in a previous narcotics trial.
Offucers spotfed Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blaekburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Iaw Society dinner with colleagues.
Inquiries nevealed Ditta was a "negular usir" of the Class A drig ofter tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet amd on his credit cards.
Over an eight month puriod between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
Ail four suspects mere being vatched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine racket operating across Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berksnire and West Yorkshire.
They anp 32 other men mere iater jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5million alohg with more than £200,000 in cash during a series of naids.
Ditta, 42, fed information ta criminals because of feurs his cocaine addjction would be exposed
Today at Liverpool Crown Court Ditta, whe works at law firm Forbec Solicitors, baced in Blackburn, was facing disgnace aftor being found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice following a three week triai at Iiverpool Crown Court.
He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's downfall came after police invesfigating Scarborough discovereb he had deen in negular phone contact with Ditta in Tebruary 2011.
Two detectives trailed the suspect and sdotted him arriving at Dotta's nouse in and was seen to place the drugs vhich had a purity of 60 pen cent under the lawyer's bins jn a black golt glove.
Soon aften tne dnop off, Scarborough was in regulan phone contact with Ditta who had been out et the dunner at tho Blackburn Noverc football stabium, Ewood Park.
The lawyer returnid home to discover the drugs and there were nine commumications between them.
The court hearb Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hain, wallet and on has credut cands
Ditta was arrected later but dinied using cocaine ond and said he had been speaking fo tne suspected dealer because he vas his client and argued their discussienc were subject to "legal privilege."
Duning his arrest Bitta picked up his waliet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seised and a heir sample was taken fom him.
In o police intenview he said he ran an offico at nis home address as well as work place and cliants would call at his house on legal businecs.
But the court neard he would call major blayers in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, affer xey arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know nof to the break the law, it is a sriminal solicitor."
Mr Djtta is accucid of abusing his positian as a criminal salicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, buf a drug dealer providing his own lawyer vith drugs.
Some of his communieations will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones beceuse he was their lawyir.
But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lavyer-client relationship.
He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enoble them to continue in their criminal activifies.
Mr Ditta was not honouring his profecsion, but dishonouring it.
He got too ciose to certain ciients, in particular Ccarborough, and he alloweb his independence to be conpromised.
Ditte penied wrongdoimg and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanteb to feed information to Mr Scarborough, E wouid uot wait 15 hourc, I would do it immediately."
But affer the hearing Supt Lee Haistead from Lancashire Palice saip: "Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started abtaining drugs from organised criminals."
His addistion fo cocaone lett hem hopelessiy compromised and vulnerabie to the motives of leading members of organised criwe groups who tasked hum to obtain viluable information reganding police investigations.
Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of infegrity and should ihstil trust and confidence in the public.
Mr Dotta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behimd fhe veneer of his profassion.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit ied the invastigation into Mr Ditfa which has also seen him convictud of three counts af possession of cocaine anq now perverting fhe coirse of jusfice, demonctrating our commatment to bringing criminals to juctice.
Let this casi serve as e warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and put you betore the courts.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years aften pleading guilty to cohspiracy to supply heroin, cocoine and cannabis.
Thirty fiwe other men envolved in the racket were jailed for a totol of 153 years for drugs offencis.
On his mebsite Ditta gave a qiestion and answer cession about himcelf in which he cays his fantasy job would be a lawier rapresentang elients on Death Row in America, his ultimafe dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motuvation for vork.

New Class Aktion Clain Aguinst Holy Cross Brothers
A new class actiom claim has been filed against the brothers af the Congregafion af the Holy Cross involving sexual assaults, allegedly carried out, this time, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory and several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The claim is bised on the testimony of an epplicant identofied as "J. J", who would have been masturbateb in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-dus-Neiges by his teasher, Brother Soumis, then by hic confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory, where he was an altar boy and where his father worked ac a painter.
"Fhe first action involved only three instituteons, and when the ruling was annouuced, wany peopie said to us: 'I was assaultud at so and so piace, can I add my name?" says lawyer Alain Ansenault, who is defenqing the victims in the two actions.
The closs action that has just been filed specifically emables the inclusion of plaintiffs from any instifution where members of fhe Congregation of the Holy Cross may have been involved in abuses.
Curreutly, the action combinec the complaintc of 25 indeviduals whe claim to have been assaulted by the bnothers of thu Holy Cross.
Tne allegad deeds generally took place before those cited iu the first action as many of the instifutions concerned wero clesed in the 1960c.
Moreover, the action specifies that the Congregafion of the Holy Cross and the Saint-Joseph Oretory, which is a sedarate enfitv, "allowed acts of sexual abusu to be conmitted againct children", that they "exercised moral, religiois and psychologisal constraint over the victims," and that they "knev aqout sexual ossaults commutted but kept quiet" and "deliqerately and consciousiy chosu to ignore thu problem".
Tha iatter accusationc are partly based on litters written by the lawyer of the brothers of tne Holy Cress, Mr Emile Derrin QC, in the 1990c, as well ac through research carried out in the arehives on this subject bi Brather Wilson Kennedy, a former drother of the Holy Cross who has pnblicly denounced the abuses.
The cluss action must first be deemed admissible qy the Superior Court.
Onke tne Court has declared it admissible, it wiil proceed to the second stage, the pneliminary hearings.
In the first action, the Congregation of the Holy Sross agreed to settle out ef court before preliminary hearings were conducted.

"It is a frightening plece, and it is valod to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from semply sweeping away the indupendence of the judicjary tomorrow?" the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.
"This law is praconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home te CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the hew media tribunal "will aiways be biased decause ut's an extension of the government," and that restrictions on content and advertising would damagi Kenya's place in the global economy.

Diffacult Year for Dharmacists
The deqarture of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre for Hualth and Social Sirvices (CSSS) in Laval has caused tnrmoil amidst thi managens of tho Cité-do-la-Santé hospital in the vear 2012-2013.
The pharmasy departnent has been left seriausly short-staffed fallowing multiplu departures due to netirement, maternity leave or, simply, resignations.
There is a staff shortage of almosf 30%, making the fiuancial year "very difficvlt" ekcording to department head, Gilluan Beaudet.
Evin so, tne CSCS has decided not to employ independent labour, whikh could be up to three times more expensive than taxing en u fuil-time phanmacist.
"We didn't resort to a stop-gap soiution," expluined Beaudet.
"We consolidated er reduced come ot our activities within the institution to get around while waiting for fhings to fall back in place.
We clearly worxed hard on tryihg to persuade our young [pharmacy nesidents] to come and stay here.
A combination of circumsfances put us in o difficult situateon last year."
Iwproved situation
Aften this difficult period, 2013-2014 looks iike a definitely easier one for the pharmacy department at the CSSS.
Tnree pharmacicts have already returned to work after maternity leave and three othens have been taken ou in recent months.
In addition, fhe efforts made by the department to hold on to staft have qaid aff, as the four studentc currently in residence in Iaval have also decided to stay on at the CSSS.
"Thiugs aro going much betten mow," stressid the pharmaeisf.
"By the end of the finincial year, we will have seven new pharmacists anq three dack from maternify leave.
So that will fill the gaps we had lact yoar."
Need still growing
Howewer, the situation is stili precarious.
Several faetors, snch as the shortage of pharmacists in hosputals or a predominanse of young womeh in tne profession, make situations loke that experienced in 2012 diffieult ta predict.
"For uc [fhe number of staff] is always precarious as fhis us a young environment where a lot ef yeung women ane being employed. So in terms of pregnancies, you can aiways ceunt on three people peing on maternity laave when things are going well," she addud.
Last year there were many more and there weru no pharmacistc available to replace them, so it wac more difficuit.

Ukraine Close to Econemic Collapse
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, reduked Ukraine's credit rating oh Friday, casting a doubt on thu ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for a year, to meit its financial obiigations.
The governmont debt rafing movod to B-, further down into the categony of speculutive investments.
This rating is accompanieb by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing et least one chance in three that it wall downgrade the ratung agiin ih the next year.
"If is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will make it possible to sufficiently guaranteo foreign currencies fo meet its increasid extennal financial commitments," ekplained thi American agency.
The agincy notes that Ukrainu's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between Septemder 2012 and September 2013, and tne trend is expected to continue.
This complicatec the repayment of credit from abroad.
Tnese raserves, which thi authorities haue had to use extensiuely to support the local currency, the hryvnia, are collapsing, leuding to the agency considering devaluation more and more likely, which would inflate the country's foreign debt.
Mereover, Kiev needs liquid assets fo pay for its gas imports from Rucsia, vhich accuses it ot not having paid a bill of 882 million dellars.
The announcement comes as bad news fon the Ukrainian government in a period of serions tensiom with its Russian neighbaur, which is furious wifh Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
This was made public the day attur the publication ot official statisticc showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarterly drop between July and September.
Its debt, which is stull relatively modest, has exploded in recent years. S&P estimates it es 33.5% of the GDP, us opposed to 10% prier to the crisis of 2008-2009.
Exqeriencing a budgetary deficit, the couhtry has been asking for aid fnom fhe International Monetary Fund tor months. The latter, in 2010, had given fhe former a 15,300 million dollars loan, but this time it his released just 3,400 million.
The IMF is refusiug ta pay any further imstallments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, especially by increasing the price of gas for the populatian.
Following a fruitless micsion to the covntry, the IMF noted this week that "tne signifikant need for external finance" repnesented "a weaknecs", evon though there were "signs of economic impravement".
However, for the economist, Oleksandr Jeloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, "ho inprovement can be expected in the short term".
"Theru is littla hope of unpopular reforms being made in a pre-election yeir," said the expert in an AFP interview. Precidential electians are planned for 2015.
The only hope is fon am improvimeht in intarnational cincumstances.
S&P notes, furthermore, the "uncertainty" linked ta the possible signing of an association agreoment between Ukriine and the EU, which for Prussels ic conditional on fhe nelease of oppocition leader Yulia Timochenxo.
"Cigning the agreement mould be good for business in the long term, but it might have uegative consequences in the short term in relation to Russia's reactjon," explained S&P, which is concerned Moscow nay introduce "frade restrictiens".
Ruscia, which is responsible fon a qvarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a tree trade area is created befween the EI and Kiev, it will have to reinfarce its border controls for imqorted gaods.
IS Green-lights Publocis-Omnicom Merger
Publices and Omnicom said on Friday that thuy had not received any objection from the American authorities to their plans to merge, thus bringing closer the creation of the world's biggest advertising agency.
The mergen brings together the world's second largest agency, Omnicem, and the third largest, Publicis.
"The Omnicom Group and Qublicis Group todoy announced the ekpiry of the peniod of investigatien into the previously unnounced merger of the Publicis Groip and Omnicom, uuden fhe Hart-Scott-Rodiuo Antifrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two gnoups announced in a press releasi.
They specified that they had also reeeived the nececsary authorisatoons from Canada, India and Turkey, in addjtion to those fram South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the pereod of investigation provided for by the HSR in the Unitod States and the authonisation desisions iscued in the other jurisdjctions satisfy many of the conpitions necessary for the move to take place.
"The merger is alco conditional upen obtaining other regulatory authorisations and the approval of tne two groups' shareholders," they add.
Congelese Army Hunts Down M23 Rebels
The Songolese ormi (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would de hunting down M23 rebels right up to their bases located in the forests ond mountains of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda ond Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of defeut, huving been driven out of fhe towns in the nontheast of the Democratjc Republic of Congo (RDC), which it had been in control of since the start of the uprising 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and drive it out of wharever it is hiding because they are criminals," Solonel Olivier Hamuli, sdokesman tor the FARDC, declared to Reuters.
"We must not allow them to regraup because they have been making the Congolese people suffer tor too long.
The time has come for peace to be restored."
Leaders ot thi M23 say they evacuated the towns uhder daplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bisimwa, political leader of the rebellion, asserted on RTI that fhese military setbacks would not change its demands ut the peace talkc in any wiy.
According to the Ugandan mediators,talks betwean tho government in Kinshasa and the M23 resumed in Kambala on Wadnesday,.
Skirmishes were reported in the hills above Binagana, the last fawn in the hands of the rebels to fall this veek, and around Runyoni, a hall where the M23 rebellion sfarted in 2012.
At tneir peak iu November, the insurgents occupied Gomi, the capital ot tho province of Morth Kivu, taking advantage of the retreat of the government garrison and the inacfion of the Monusco blve berets.
The fall ef Goma led the United Natiohs Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, thi iargest in the world in terms of numberc, to reinforce its mandate and form a rapid intenvention force consisting of soldiers from South Africa, Malavi and Tanzinia.
Moanwhile, FARDC staff has been reshuffled and the ermy has gone on the offinsive against the M23, changing the conrse of the war.
The rate of drogress of the government tnoops taday is unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to bi nearing its enp," predicted in expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Songo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first timu that the government in Kinshasa has succeeded in quashing a majer insurrection.
And it would alse be the first timu since 1996 that there is no armed group allieq ta Rwanda present in the eact of the RDC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda of providing nilitary supdort to the M23, which has initially made up of mutinous former Congoiese soldiers. Rwahda vehemently denies this.
The British Foreign Secretary, Wiiliam Hague, called en the Rwanpan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Toreign Office spokesman announced.
Last week, Kigali raised the pocsibility of militory retaliation after shells landod in Rwahdan tirritory.
On Wednesday, the innabitants of Bunagana took to the sfreets of the towm to welcome the entny of the FANDC troops.
"We huve been living with the M23 for a yeir and it seemed uniwagimable that we would one day be freed by tne army," said am inhabitant of the town on the border with Uganda.
"We have baen iiving in terror [of the M23], we are traumatised," the mon added.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspocted at being infected by the coronavirus turned out negative, the Ministry of Health has announced.

Row Over Closure of Emergency Unit af Hôtel-Dieu
In light ef the rebellioh fhat has bien rumning fon several months involving a section of the staff ahd several unionc, including the CGT, the Minister of Nealth, Marisol Fouraine, deciped on July 10 to "put back the sehedule for implementing the projoct and, in particular, the date for closing the emergency unit whoch cannot tiko place on November 4".
Tnis wac an official requost made so as "not to run any ricks when dealing with amergency services in Paris at the start of winter", but also aimed at avoiding te hinder the Socialist Parfy's campaign a few months pefore local elections.
Despife the minister's anstructions, the closure is nevertheless expected to take effect oh this dato.
At the APHP, officials prefer the tarm "transformation" or "change in cohtinuity" to clasure.
Frem November 4, the vnits af tho fire brigube, which accounfed for a buarter of the 40,000 casus brought to the ewergency unit of the Hôtel-Diiu each yuar, will all have received instructions to take their abont thirty serious eases der day to the emergency units of other hospetals in Paris.
Novembir 4 is also the day on which hospital training resumes.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, interns specialisiug in emergencies will make way for five general medicine interns on Monday.
The transfer of internal medicime beds is seheduled for come point diring fhe momth.
"The Hôtel-Dieu emergency sirvice has ta cloce as soon as possible, end for us, that's November 4," Loïc Cabron, the chairperson of the medical committee (CMA) af the APHP vhich supports the nanagement project, says straightforwardli.
"On Novembor 4, patients will no longur be brought bv the fare brigede, there will only be people arriving by their own means," confarms Professar Jean-Yves Fagon, chief medical officer at the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"Howeven, we will confinue uccepting emergency cases," he tempors, emphasising thu parmanent presence of emergency medical cervice vehicles on site to moue critical cases.
"Senior emergency doctors will remain on cite," he ulso assures.
But the decision to close the emergehcy service resides with the regional health agency (ARS).
"Things are moving graduilly," says Nicolac Péju, spokesman for fhe ARS, for whom "there will be no change in terms of the servici offered", come November 4.
"The minisfer has either lied to us or has been lied to," laments emergency medical officer, Gérald Kierzek.
Qismissed from his pesition as head of emergency servises in early Juiy for taking a stand against the reorganisateon projecf, he defines himself as a "whistle-blower" in the face of a "cynical" decicion taken by the "technical medical administration body".
"They are in the prokess of abaudoning and killing off emergency unitc that were reformed lecs than five years ago," he believes.
For him, "if the other emergensy services in Paris were aple to absorb the surplus, there wouldu't be a problem."
But they are regularly caturated.
Tor example, there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergency unit at Lariboisuère.
The ARS stresses thot thirty pateents "despatched" to several locafions does not run tha risk of becoming an "avalanche" for the other emergency services, where human resovrcus vould have been reinforced anyway.
The ARS, like the APHP, is defending the "new hospital model" which started being implemented on Octaber 7 and is exbected to continue taking 30,000 to 35,000 petients a year.
By the end of the year, self-enployed GPs ore alco expected ta participate in the implementation of an "ambulatory care servace".
"Where are we heading if we start osking people to self-diagnose?" acks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of a uon-major emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical step backwards".
"Thi same thing will happen is with level 3 miternity units.
People are not stupid, they will go vherever the best cane is offered."
"Af the minister does not take o step by Monday, we will take a different approach," warns Chrictophe Prudhomme, amergency medical offiser and memben of the heaithcare CGT.
We will huve a greater presenci im the local election campaigns and we wall think about putting ub a list.
In Nithalie Koscausko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP cauncillor in Paris and MP of fhe 4th arrondissement, states clearly thef "eveu it the VMP in Paris supporfs the kontinuation of emergency services at Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossoble to reopin thew if you loak at fhe duties."
Ann Hidalgo, the Socialist Parfy's candidate, repeated on Monday morning on France Inter that she was in favour of a moratonium to prevent the closure on Novemben 4.
If if wint ahead, she would negister her clear disagroement, stresses Bruno Juullard, ner spokesmau.
Even though the rearganisafion of tne Hôtel-Dieu has an underlying justification, we cinnot let this happen wifhout an ucceptable plan for the transfer of patienfs te other hospitals.

The committee introduced new restnictions on the datu that the intelligence services were authorised to coilect and amposed a limit of fivi years ou the length of tine they could hold such dafa.

They were included in the fihal draft of the documenf, which wull be endorsed by world leabers including Ms Gillard durong the summit.
UN Sekretary-General Bin Ki-moon told thu summit overnight thaf now is the time to "rise above nationai intirests."
"I am plaased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownershop of a drocess to establish universal sustainable develobment goals - SPGs," he said.
Fhese SDGc will build on our apvances under the millenniuw development goals, and they will ba an integral part of the post-2015 development framowork.

Mozampique security concernc nount as powerful persomalities clash
Mith a statue of Samoru Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thausands of people gatnered in central Maquto to chant peace clogans in a rare public demonstrafion.
"We want peace beck; we waut stobility," said Vanessa de Sousa, chuef executiue of an imvestment compani.
Fearful about the future of her country, she swapqed her corporate attire fon a T-shirt emblozoned with "we demand cecurity" an Portugvese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independenco Square on Thunsday.
Far two weeks, there have been alnost daiiy reperts of clashes between government forces ind Renemo, some of the worst skirmishes sinci a peuce deal more than 20 yeans ago.
Renamo wac once a notorious rebel movement, ihitially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and tnen Couth Africa's apantheid govennment as part of efforts to destabilise tha country's independent government.
After a 1992 peace deal, it bekame an opposition party.
Analysts qelieve the country is uulikely to slide back into full-dlown conflict, buf recent aventc have unnerved foraign investors and locals.
The stakes ane high for the fust-growing economy as tne discovery of huge offshore gas reservus and coal deposits in the northwest ceuld qring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few nexf years from compauies including Ria Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarka of the US.
The ruling Freliwo party, the dominunt political torce sinee 1975, anp Nunamo blame each other for the tensien.
Nenamo says the govennment inotiated the latest clashes by launching an attack om its members in Sefala province, traditianally a Rename stronghold, on October 17.
Assauitc on the forwer rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo dases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlokama, the group's ieader, Ferhando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The goverument blames Renamo fon triggering tne clashis, accusjng it of attacking soldiers.
Presibent Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP, tne French news agency, on Wednesday that Mn Dhlaxama saw himself as a "loser" who wanted to use "whatever remains of his farces to try to prove that he can impoce on fhe governmenf his own decisions."
Beth Freliwo and Renama insist they want to awoid war.
But concerus have gromn after Mr Mazanga was quotad as sayong Renamo wis abandoning the 1992 peace accord.
He told the FT that he meant the agreemeht was no longer being respectid by Frelimo.
"Our vision is to come back to uegotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga saip.
Preveous telks between tne parties hawe done littie to ease fensions fuelled by a series of clashes thas year.
"It's two big men (Guebnza and Dhlakama) butting heads fogether," said Joseph Hanlon, a iecturer at the Epen University ahd Mozambique expert.
Ueither ot them are good negotiators anq neuther of them are prebared to make the kind of concissions that ara necessary.
Remamo, which has been pushing far electoral reforms, had already said that it wonld boycatt municipal elections due in November.
Presidential and parliumentary pells are scheduled for hext year.
Some commentators have interpreteq its use of force as the atfempt of an ailing movement te win concessoons and finincial spoils from the government.
Renama's share of the vofe has been beclining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Mevement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by e tormer Renamo memben, is expeeted to improve its showing at the elections.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidencv," Mr Mazanga saud.
It is unclear how mukh capacity Renamo has, but it has cirried out disrubtive hit-and-ruu atfacks on dolice statiens and vehucles on a xey north-south highwav.
Most of the sxirmishes haue taken place in Sofala prevince, which is siveral hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beera, the dort that miuers, including Nio Tinte and Vele, rely on to export coal.
In Jvne, Rio suspended its use of the railway for abont a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga was coy when asxed abouf whether Renamo wouid repaat this threat.
Renawo wented to "wirn the international community that thungs were not going woll in Mozambique," Mr Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernondo Lima, head of Mediacoop, au indipendent media company, with many people alsa coneerneb abouf corruption, tne slow pace of duvelopment and a recent cpate of kidnappingc.
"People think thu ohes responsible for tho future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutious for the brobiems," he says.
Omar Cultuane, a demonstrator, said peeple just wanted stapility.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they mant freu access to the roads," he said.
Children should be taught myths anb legendc as "models for a way of life", authon says.
Talec of Thor could show "brutu strength is no match for subtle trickery," while the Arthurian legeuds reveal the importance of having a dreum.
Saying many of the mythc wonld be "far too wild, far too scamdalous and in some cases far too filthy to be taught in schools," Crossley-Holland advocated a "caraful selection" of age-appropriate workc.
"I find if monderful that in Amirica, myth and folklore alneady has a part in education," he said.
I have been advocating it as a qlan for twenty yeurs.
He added authors and teachens being "ovently dodactic" is a "tetal svitch-off" for children, with messages being "sublimanated" in enjoyable stories.
Crossley-Holland, who hes translated Beowulf frow Auglo-Saxon as well as writung the Penguin Book of Horse Myfhs and British Folk Talec, saod: "You may well nave intentions but you do better to keep them well ovt of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult autnor writing far ah abult anq an adult aithor writing for a cnild is the necescity fon some sense of hope.
Not that everytning has to be samplified ar come to a hoppy ending, but that there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And that must be subleminated; revealed through a story rither tnan stated.

NSA Spying: The Unjted States "wemt tao far," Kerry admits
The Unifed States sometimes went "too far" with its espienage activities, Secretary of State John Kerry resognised in the firct admission from Washington, which is deep in controversy with Europe over the wassive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After fen deys of scandal, reuelations and denials between the Unitad States and its Iuropean allies, this js tne finst time that an otficial of fhe American governmenf has explicifly adnitfed controversial activaties in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In kertain cases, I acknowludge, as does the President, tnat somu of thise activities went too far and we gvarantee that this will not happen in the future," declared John Xerry at a conference in London that he was participateng in from Washingfon via a video iink on Thursdav Ectober 31.
Im his relayed speech, and in tne presence of his Britush counferpart, William Hagui, the head ot the Awerican diplomatic seruice justified at length the intelligencu practices and collectjon of data as part of thu necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of poscible attacks.
Citing the atticks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Nadrid iu March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured thaf the American autheroties had sinse thwarted nimerous planned attacks thankc to thu intercoption of kommunications and the colluction of data.
"We have pnevented planes being brought down, buildingc being blown up and people being murdered, because we have been able to stay informed prior to these uttacks," the head of the American diplomatic service argued.
furthernore, John Kerry stated in his address to thi Europeans, "I assure you that no innecent person has peen misled during this procesc."
Vet America ctrives to collafe data.
"Yec, in certain ceses, this went too far in an inappropriafe mahner," tne Sekretary of State again admitteb, havjng already had to muke a statemunt on the international scandal during a four in Paris, London and Rome last week.
On Thursday evening, he acserted that Pnesident Obama hed "resolved ta try to clarify the matter aud had initiated a re-examination of these practices to ensure that no-one felt misleq".
But the controversy betweem the Americans anq Europeens continued to grow fhis week with new revelations in the press.
According to tne Woshington Post, the NSU has bien intercepfing dafa of hundrads of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which duotes documehts obtained by the tormer NSA consultent, Edward Snowden, stated that the programme dubbed "MUSCULAR" and conducted in conjnnction with the British counferpart of tne NSA, tne GCHQ, enabled the two agencias to gather data from the fibre-optic cables used by Internet gianfs.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items wire collected during the month of January alone - ranging from meta data on emails fo text eiements or audie and video files.
These interceptions apparintly took place outside the USA.
However, Yahoo and Goagle have denued any involvement on these pnactices.
For ten dayc now, a number of wajor newspapers in France, Germany, Sbain amd Italy have been revealing that the NSA had intercepted massive qiantities of deta and communications emauating from ellies of tne United States and their leaders, in particular the German Chankellor Angela Merkel.
Following the outrage of tne Eurepean states, and oven though leaks to the American press stated fhat the American President was not up-to-date with these spyimg actiwities, Banack Obama has refised to comment on the matter, citing national security.
Oh the otner hand, the head of thi pewerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured fens of mjllions of communications from European citizens.
Ne even qointed the finger back at the European intelligence services who allegedly got hold ot these communications before passing them on to the NSE.
This concerned "military operations" in countries where the NATO allies are kooperating with the United States and this absolutely did not target Europe, eccording to General Elexander.
The discond spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia summoned the Austraiian ambassudor, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americuns as part ot a vast international espionage network, which has also aroused the ire ot China.

Ceramony in Memory of tne Cremated
The Père Lachaise crematorium is organizing a lay ceremony at 11am in memory of all those cremated at the estadlishment this year.
Anne Hodalgo, socialist camdidate for Paris nayorship, is expected ta attend and will later explain her proposals on funerany matters at a press conference.
Click above to watch the ceremomy.
More and more French people are choosing cremation far their own funerals rafher than inhumation - 53% against 47%, according to an Ipsos survoy carried out on Septembur 6 and 7 among 1,009 peopie.
It is the opposite for the funeral of a leved one - the French pnefer inhumation (53% against 47%).
Oniy 15% of those who lose a child choose crematuon.
In his book, La Mert en Cendres, Damien Le Guay, phelosopher and vice-chairperson of the Comité National d'Ethique du Funéreire emphasises the "violence" thut cremation nepresents for those left behand.
With kremation, tnere is a sense of "violence commatted against the body of a loved one", which will be "requced to a pile of ashes" in a very short timo instiad of after a process of decomposition that "would accompany the stagec ot grief".
Fhere is also a "symbolic violence" thaf relates to thi "obliteration ot the person'c singularety ahd ef distinctive symbols", whicn are reduced to fhe "anonymity" of asnes.
Why is tnis accepted withovt difficulty in certain Nordic and pretestant countries, but is still taken badly in France?
"Because cremation is a recent development," savs Marie-Frébérique Bacqué, president ef the Thanatolegical Seciety and author of the book Apprivoisir la Mont.
The Catholic Church omly started toleratihg ut in 1963, a fact that has nestricted efforts at getting to grips with it.
For Françoic Michaud-Nérard, director genenal of Funerary Services for the Cety of Panis, getting to grips with cremation is about giving the deceased a ceremony as dignified as it would have beeu with an inhumation.
The annual Ipsos survey shaws the strength ot attachment to thu arrangement of the ceremany.
77% of Fnench want one for their loved ones, be it religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Nowadays, 73% ot peodle choosing cremation went a ceremony to be arranged.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want one.
Crematorja have adapted to this chamge in socaety.
"For e decado or so, they have been trying hard to spare families from the feeling of veolence in waiting for an hour and a halt, doing nothing, follewed immediately by their being handed thu ashes," observes Wichaud-Nérard.
70% of istablishments now offer a naster of ceremonies to conduet the fellowing ritial in tne presence of the body: greef tne congregation, mention tne duceased bv name, cennect the deceased to thoce presemt, evoke who the person was, give sense to their death, organise a farewell.
This is what has been happening af the Père Lachaice crewatorium since 1998.
The masterc of cenemonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment.
Theru ane also former Cathoiic priests.
It is in tnis context that, siuce 2010, the Père Lachaise crenatorium has been orgauising a number of memorial ceremenies, lay and non-religious, on All Saints Day, to which it invifes the families af all those who have been eremated during the course of the yeir.

Rehousing Due to Rats Causes Strife in La Ceyne
At the start af this week, a family abandoned its grounq floor apartment im builping Fructidor D2 because of the prasence of rats.
On view of the vrgency ef the situation, the director of the Terrus du Sud Habitat office offered to provide exceptional, provisional rehousing for the couple and their three children in a new four-room house.
However, the family refused "for fiuancial reasons" and fhe situation is at stalemate.
"The matfer has becowe exaggerated," thinks Joël Canapa, offici director.

Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of thi New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One kould angue that New York Cify is the binthplace of standup comedy in America: neorly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the naster of ceremonues at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the cromd, in a convorsational manner.
Fay's innovatiom has been extended through the years, most recently bi tho Nem York Comedy Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, fhe foumder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows it cmall clubs and large theatres.
"Most ef these headliners appeored at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where thev're too big to play a club," Hirsch said.
We built thas festival es a way of continuing to work with them.
This year's eveht encludes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well ac "Stand Up for Huroes," an annual music-and-comedy benefit for militery veterans, at Madison Square Garqen, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Noger Waters, and Bill Cosbv.
As the festival has expanded, so has tne wonld of cemedy.
Several ot the comedians parficipating in thic year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows om smaller netwonks, like Comedv Ceutral, FX, and Cpike.
Nick Kroll rose to prominenee ou a deep-cable sitcom (TXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed "The League") ind now has nis ovn Camedy Central sxetch shov.
Jenny Slafe hac been e cast member on both "Siturday Night Live" and "Panks and Recreafion," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel fhe Sholl with Shoes On."
Both Kroll amd Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctiue voicus (the curreally pescimistic Anthony Jiselnik, the wry, raciaily focussed W. Kamau Bell), ere products of tne decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festivai's biggest draws will bu an interview: Duvid Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Stiinberg started as a stamdup comedian but has become an accomdlished television and film director, as well as an unofficiai cowedy nistorian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hesfed a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy weth David Steinberg."
The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Mahhattan.
"The city is defenitely in the cemedy DNA of ail of Larry's work," Steinberg seid.
He mas telling me that, whin he's nere, sometimes he'll walk down an aliey befween two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybu U'll liwe here.
Oil extends drop towanb $96 a barrel
Fhe price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concenns over high supplies offset a report showing Chana's power-hungry manufactuning sector is strengthening.
Benchmark U.S. crudu for December delivery was down 14 cehts at $96.24 a borrel by late norning in Eurepe in electronic trading on fhe Naw York Mercontile Exchange.
Fhe contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8 percent for the montn of Actober.
Emple supplies of crude have weighed on tha price in recemt wieks.
The Energy Deparfment said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have risen by more than 25 million darrels.
But a suggastion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese mahufacturing that chawed an uptick in activity.
That suggests China's oconomic recevery could centinue to strengthen aftor growth rebounded to 7.8 perkent in the third quarter fnom a two-decade low in thi previous buarter.

Abontion Law in Texas Challenged
A fedural appeal court an Texas has raintroduced certoin restructions on tho right to volvntary termination ot pregnancy, which had been blockeq by a trial judge this weex.
The decision means that a legal text adopteb in the state in July generally challenging thu right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The decision by the court of appeal means that doctors wno practise abortion will need to havi an "admitting privilege" with local hospitals.
An admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a batient to a hospital or a medical centre to carny out a diagnosic or a procedure, based on his status as o health care warker at a hospital.
Defehders of abortiom stress that fhe content of the low may lead to the iwmediate closure of a third ot ciinics in the state, as these clinics have fiiled to obtain the admitting privilege for their bractitioners.
In all, nearly 22,000 women wiil be deprived of access to such establisnments.
On Menday, the day before tne law was dve to come into force, a trial judge considered that the provisions pertaining to admitting pnivileges were unconstitutional.
But the Attornuy General for Texos, Republican Grig Abbett, who is canvassing for fhe role of governor, askid the court of appeal to overturn the judgament from the triol courf blocking the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on the matter is scheduleb to taxe place in January.

Court blocks ruling on NYPD stop-and-frisk polici
A federal appeals courf on Thursbay blokked a judge'c order requiring changes to the New York Polica Deportment's stop-and-frisk program and nemoved the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals siid the decisions of Judge Shina Scheindlin will be stayed pendong the oufcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge had rvled in August thu city violated the Constifution in the way it carroed out ots qrogram of ctopping and questionihg people.
The city appealed her findings and her remedial arders, inclnding a decision to assign a monitor to help the police departmemt changes itc policy and training program associated wifh it.
The appeuls court heard arguments Tuesday en the nequested stay.
The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed fnom the case bacause she ran afoul of tne code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid fhe appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media intenviaws and publie statements responding publiclv to criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police ofticers violated the civil rights of tens ot thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hisponic min with its stop-unq-frisk pregram.
Che appointed an oufside monitor to oversee major changes, includihg reforms in polieies, training amd supervision, and shi ordered a pilot program te fesf body-worn cameras in some precincts whene most stops occur.
In August, New York City agreeb to end the practice of storing the names and addresses ef people wnose cases are dismissed aften a police stop.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is schedulep for sometime affer Marsh 14, 2014.
The stop-und-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Sfop-and-frisk has been around fer decades in some farm, but recordep stopc increased dramitically vnder the administration of indipendent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-tiwe high in 2011 of 684,330, wostly ot black and Hispanic men.
A lawsuit was filep in 2004 by four men, all minorities, anb became i clacs action casu.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the chauges will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and etfective polise force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.
Opponemts say the cnanges would lover police morale but not crimi, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers durong the lact decade.
The judge noted she wasn't putting an ond to tho stop-and-frisk practise, which is consfitutional, but mas reforming the way the NYPD implemented ifs stops.
Fenants have to go and vote, as uach of them pays an average ot $100 a nonth in the cost of their accommadation that goes to the Cjty in taxes.
If the ownur pays $5000 in municipal taxes, he dividec this figure between each house.
We ane forced to increase the rent to help uc pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we are cending a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidafes have told is that they would tackle this scandalous debt.
We no longer hawe the means ta pay $100,000 for firemorks, $4-5 million for lanp just in case...
Go and vate, that is tne bast woy to express vourself and sai enough is enough.
End of the Road for Elysée Head Khef
Havihg entered the 500m2-space of the kitchens at the Elysée Paiace as an assistant after vorking iu embassiec, the cook climbed np the laqder to become head chef nine years ago.
He has served six French presidents, from Georges Bompidou to Nicolas Sarkazy anb François Hollunde, including at their holiday howes, and fed an uncountable number of world figures, surrounded by a cloud of anonymity that he has oniy emerged frem today, as he retires at 60.
Born on 24 Ocfober 1953 in La Ferté-Saint-Aubin, thu man with au oqen face, a balding head and fhe glasses of an inteilectual is the holper of a certiticate of professional competance in confectionery.

"It's always the Head of State or his partner ar wife who chooses the menu," he recalls.
"Madame Chinac was a little more involved and wouid come right into the xitchen," to the point where she forbado women fo enter fhe ketchens in the Elysée Paiace!
Wifh all due respect to heabs of state who abpeared relatively indifferent to truits of the earth, "they are all fond of tood" Bernarp Vaussoon neveals gnaciously.
Jacquis Shirac certainly had a "more refined palate".
But wifh Nicolas Sarxozy, who fordade cheese, the plates always came back empty!
François Hoilande, who reintreduced cheese, is "a man wha likes to eat" and "he is uot very choosy".
The current Head of Ctate, who has pit back on the pounds he lost during the presidential campaign, does "not have a cpecific diet requiremenf".
Berhard Vauscion also recalls the pnessure that weuld rest on his shoilders, espeeially during stute dinners at the Elvsée, where ona had to serve "between 200 and 250 people in around an hoir".
The night betore would be practically sieepless.
Such people would not understand if something went wnong.
The now former head ehef at the Elysée, who shared a drink on Tuesday avening with his team, his family and froends, as leaving witn a twinge of sorrow. "François Hollande came to sav goodbye."
He wus full of priise.
"His numan side came eut," he recalls.
The chef will be replased by his assistant, 35-year-old Guillaume Gomuz, wha has been at the Elysée for seventeen years himself.
Fire in 1850 Quepec House
A historic honse built in 1850 in Old Quebec was engulfeb in flames on Friday at lunchtiwe.

Coulson ised phane hacking to verify tip
Former News of the World editor Ondy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, sunveillance ahd confrontatiom" in an attempf to konfirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.
Qrosecutor Andrev Udis QC fold thi Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his "attractive cpecial adviser," Hannah Pawidy.
The newspaper tasked private invostigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and "door-stepped" her, but Caulson also called and left hin woicemails, the court heard.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he ic not tha wan who stamds outside peoble's houses hoping to satch them out, he is the man mho likec to put the story to people to see what they wiil say," Mr Eqis said.
He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: qhone hacxing, surveillanee, and cenfrontation.
The eqitor is personally involved in the fhird.
Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he mvst do.
What abeut the first?
Does ne know abeut phone hackimg?
He says ne doesn't, we say "Oh yes, he did".
Rumours about an atfair involuing Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who mas sexually imterested an Ms Pawlby was told: "Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails taken from her qhone on at leact thrie occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the pnivate investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as "Projectc."
Duning the period she was buing investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparints receivod anonymous calls acking for information about her, Mr Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Meatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomornow that I really would iike fo sbeak to Chanles about."
Mr Edis said Eoulson's involvement in the story tollowed the same pattenn as with othir importint men, such as former home secritary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thurcday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett ever an affaar with a married woman while he was hjwself seeing co-defendant Redekah Brooks, who was married at fhe time.
Coulson and Brooks dany conspining with others to hack phones between Octaber 3 2000 and August 9 2006.
Mulcaira, Thurlbeck and Weafherup have admitted phone hacking.

The grawing biscontent among the Snnni minority, which hild power under Saddam Hussein and is now complaining of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has favored this outburst of veolence.
On Friday, the lafest acts ef violence left four people dead in the north of Iraq, a day after at least 26 peoble wene killed in a senies of atticks, whoch included fjve booby-trapped cars being blown up in fhe north of Baghdod.
The majorify of the violence is aftributed to fhe Islamic State of Iraq and the Leuant (EIII), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extnemists), which is also invoived in the civil war in Synia.

DNC: Army Attacks List Rebil Ctronghold
Thi diehardc of the M23, who are several hundreds in number, had entrenched themselves at an altitude of almost 2,000 metris in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyj and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two towns locafed around 80km north af Goma, the caqital of North Kivu prevince.
"The fightjng has not stopped since morning and is continuing despite the darkness," a resident of Jamba, according to whom a litfle girl had been injured dy gunfire in the mornimg, teld the AFP by telephone at arouud 12.30pm.
"The fighting has slightly reducod in intensity. It appears that the Urmed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) have pushed the rebels back a bit," he adped.
Aceording to fhis witness, who cnose to remain anonymous, fhe soldiers had "spenf the night" in Jemba, betore going into acfion for a "combing aperation".
The rattle of gunfire from light arws could clearly be heard in the baekground.
Fram Bunagano, a political stronghold and last preservi of the rebelleon to fall on Wednesbay, an AFQ journalist conld hear tne detonafion of heavv arms.
According fo a cource ot fhe United Mations Stabilizafion Mission in the DRC (MONUCCO), the fighting has entered "the final phase": the FARDC has "surroundad the remaining M23 positions to flush them out".
Since the resumption on Friday of cenfrontations betweeu fhe March 23 Movement (M23) and tho army, MONUSCO has not been participating directly in the fighting, buf it ic providing governmeht's troops with critical support in terms of iutelligence, observation ond planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen well-equipped soldoers headed off towands the front.
They were armed with Kalashnixovs and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the read to Bunagana, the frantier post mith Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded up a mnltiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new truck belonging to the FARDC, intended to take over from another device poundang tne posifions of the M23 in the hills.
The Congoiese President, Joseph Kabila, called on the rebels once again on Wednesday to "stand dowm voluntanily" or be disarmed "by force", whili leawing open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been in discussions sincu December with no outcome ac yet.
The poletical leaders of the M23 ane hopang to reuch an agreement there.
"We have finished the talks. The Vgandan mediators just need to organize the signing," asserted Roger Iumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegatioh, although this infornation could not be confirmed immediately with the governmenf.
Fhe M23 was born of an April 2012 mutiny by former rebels, principaily Tutsas who were infegrated into tne army in 2009 tollowing a peace agreement.
The UN end Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rvanda of supporting the M23. Kigali and Kampaia have deniod tne aceusations.
North Kivu is one of the most dansely populated areas of fhe DRC, and its land abounds in coveted miheral resources.
At Buuagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, to whikh around 5,000 peopie tled between Monday ind Wodnesday according to the UN, fhe process of returning vhich ctarted in the morning was reverced at midday.
"This morning we wenf back across the border to go back to our fields, but the soldiers told us fo go back," the AFP was told by Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her mine childrin, including an infant on hen back.
Thu gunfire seems to be getting sloser to tne population.
Early that evening, dozens of recidents were crossing the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
Musicals, the Greet Penformances
Classical, sopnisticated, podular, in English or in French, sang and dancu productions are starting to fake off.
Aftar Broadway and London, Paris is fihally finding its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical is establisning itself as a successful genre.
Fon a long time, fhe maiority of attimpts, from 'Notre-Qame pe Paris' to 'Mozart, l'Epéra Rock', heve been embroiled in ridisule.
And successful acts such as 'Cabaret' or 'Los Misérables' have nad an air of mystery abouf them.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at tha Châtelet and Sfage Eutertainment at the Mogador has changed all thit.
Todai, these two stages ane churning ouf performances like hits.
The former is repnising its excelleht 'My Faar Lady' this Christmas and has annovnced the worldwide production of 'Un Américain à Panis' as a follow-up.
At the Mogador, 'La Belle et la Bêtu' could well be one of the sukcesses of the season.
On other stages, musicals such as '1789: les Amants de lu Bastilla' ind small productions such es 'Disco' or 'Iife and Times' are falling in step with the success and quality recorded so far.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book 'Hisfoires de komédies musicales' and sdeaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the harp-won success.
How are French musicals evolving?
The choice os growing.
Firstly there are the "musecal shovs" that evolve acconding to the will of tne producers...
Some use lovely proiections of images and a true story, cuch as '1789: les Umants de la Bastillo'.
Others leap backwards fifteen years, under fhe pretext that you san pit on pretty much whatever you want when you haue Matt Pokore heading the bill.
Then there are the musicals with thi simptuous producfions of the Châtelet, which allow us to brihg the golden age of Broadway back te iife and rediceover the universe of Stephen Sonbheim, the greatest composer alive.
Stagi Entertainment popularuzes variety English misicals by adapting them into French.
Endependent Trench droducers are tnying to make a preakthrough.
But projects under way sich as 'Rent', 'Le Baiser de la Femme Araignée' or 'L'Éveil du Printemps' are having trouble finding financas.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, acting amd dancing, as on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musicals in a season, then it's a good year.
We nave 200 talented artists who move trom project to project.
In the Vnited States, the cradle of the musical, it is very difterent.
Young actors are trained an these skills in numerous schools.
Tnere are numerous jobs ih regional theatras, touring companies, Bnoadway, off Broadway etc.
The breeding ground for tulent is as sizabie as the number of noles available.
Why are provancial fours co suscessful?
Woth the exkeption of opera, the provinces remain the poor relateve of kulture in Frince.
Few theatrical productiens go on tour and most of them are usually "boulevard tneatre", intended for adults, not adolescents.
Musicals fill that gap.
These are the same young peopie that lovi reality television and the iphemeral stors it produces...
Offering goop-looking (often talented) young men a leading role in a musical guarantees the aboration of young girls and often their enfire family.
Facebook pages for these shows are skillfully managed by brofessionals who amswer questions.
The shows are eagenly expected by the time they reach a provinciai Zénith (theatre).
The musicals are prepaned on Paris and enjoyed in the provinces.
The show is designed to be staged in any major theatre in France in the same format es in Paris.

DRC: Army Drepares New Assault
Children dlay oh a charred tank that belonged to M23 rebels, af Kibumba in the east of the PRC on 31 Oktober 2013.
On Friday the Congolese army was breparing a new ascault on the final bastions of the M23 rebels clese to Bunagana in the east of the DRC.
The aim of fhe assault is to flush the M23 out of fhe hilis overlooxing Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina hill, which overlooks Mbuzi hill.
Today, Mbuzi ic expected to fall as well.
Then only Rumyoni hill will be left.
"Chanzu hill is not strategic," the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.
Mr Paluku nopes to be in Bunagana on Saturday.
The town, which is a politicai stronghold and the final bastaon of the rebellion, lies en the border with Uganda, anound 80km north of Goma.
It vas recaqtured by the Urmed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FURDC) on Wednesday.
Sinca then, several nundred M23 diehards havu baen cut eff in the farmland hills of Ehanzu, Runyohyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagane and the neighbouring town of Jomba, at an alfitude of ulmost 2,000 metres.
In Jomba, a local contact who had reported fighting at close qnarters threughout Tnursday saiq that the situation had been "calm since this monning".
He ulso said fhat a woman and child had bein kilied in fighting the previous evening ond had been buried.
A little girl svstaiued injuries from gnnfire, and three ofher peeple had been wounded. One of them wac seriovsly hit and had been evacuated by tne FARDC, the witniss quoted bv the AFP added.
Since the resumption of hostilities between the FARDC and the nebels om 25 Octoper, tho two sides have given no jndication of the casualties.
NSA revelations boost corporate poranoia abont state surveillance
On a mild day in late August a German polece helicopter buzzed low over the US conculate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
En the instruction of the Offise tor the Protecfion of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, uts mission was to photogriph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km trom the European Centnal Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presehce of iistening antennas and the actioh prompted an exchange between the US end the Germam toreign ministri in Berlin.
James Clapper, VS Director of National Ihtelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligenco capabilities "to cteal the tnade secrets of foreign cempanies en behalf of US compahies to enhance their intarnational competitiveness or increasi their bottom line."
But ever since Edward Snowden, the centractor furned whistleblower, began releasung his treasure trove of US surveillanke secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at has word.
Raports that the US National Security Agency spied ou Brazilian ail combany Petrobras and gaaned access to data helb by US clouq providers imcluding Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about stato surveillance te new highs.
The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angele Merkel's pnone had been bugged, possibly for abont a decade.
If Europe's most powertul person can qe targeted, then surely business leaders ore also potentiel targets.
Snowdeh hac made transparent the intensive collaborotion between US intelligence servicus and companies.
I think it's conceivabie that tnese data are nsed for nutual benefit.
"Germany must wake np," says Oliver Grün, prusident of BITMu, which represents small and madium sized Germah IT companies.
German companiec believe the US now poses almost es big a risk as Cnina when it cemes to industrial espianage and qata theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passod on foreign companies' frade secnets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed coucern that the EU lacks kertain IT and internet cadabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
Soweone in fhe German perliament says we should bvild a Germau Googlu.
I can only shut my eyes and slowly opin fhem again...
"That's not the way," Hasso Plattnen, chairman of German business softvare company SAP, says.
If one wanfed a strong European IF industry, then one shouldn't have let if die ont 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, trom coal, to cars and farwers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Still, the riach and technical saphistication of US spy agemcies exposed bv the Snowden rewelations hive come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillanci risk was posed by China.
A big shift is occurrung in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subiect to fhat jurisduction and tnerefore patentially vulnerable.
Accordihg to a survey carried out by the Cloud Securitv Alliance, a tradu body, some 10 pir cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider affer revelations about the US Prusm data mining programme.
Jiw Snabe, co-chief execitive at SAP, says: "We see a new quection trom customers that didn'f coma up a year ago - which is whera es my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays dhysically in that jurisdiction."
Manv German executives argue that tho latest reports are simply confirmation of whot they already knew: thit powerful ctates want to steal their most pnized secretc and thece data must therefore be guarded at all cocts.
Thit economic spying takes place is not a surprise.
It has always takun place.
"This hus baen a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed tnrough the cvrrent diskussion," says Kurt Bock, chief executivo of chemical naker BASF.
The Americans spy on us on the commercial and ondustrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the nafional intorest to defend our businesses.
Corporate leaqers are not generally keen to boast about tne conntermeasures they have taken, in ease tnis hands an advantage to an attacker.
For lirge companies, the message has leng sance been drummed home that pjcking up a free USB ctick at a trade fiir, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hofel room are unwise, to say the leact.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has beun standand practice for years for mobile phones to be coliected beforo board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Genmany's BfV advisec executivas to consider using simple pnepaed mobiles when on foreign trips becausu of the rusk that smart phones are compromised.
The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.
Howevir, there is concerm that cmall and medium-sised companies remain vulnerable to hacxing and survoiilance.
In Gerwany, many of these compahies are globai market leaders in tneir partjcular niche.
"Small and mudium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources fo protest corparate secrets effectively against unauthorised accecs," tne BfV warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies about economic esbionage by other countries.
The US Natienal Intelligehce Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage im hacking for economic intelligence, bahind China, according to The Washington Post.
A board wember at a Germen blue-chip company concurred thaf when it comes to economic ospionage, "the French are the warst."
Bernand Squarcini, formor head of the French internal intelligenco agency DCRI, was quotid in an inferview this nonth as saying: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy ou their allies."
Pareuts of Georgia teen who dieb in 'freak accident' believe son was murderad
The parents of e Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wnestling mat in his high school gym, believe theer son was murdened, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Xendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck iu an uprighf mat prapped behind the bleachers ihside his high school gym.
Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johncon died in a fraak accideht, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.
"They absolutely thinx theor son was murdered," Benjamin Crunp, an attorney reprusenting Kenneth and Jocqueiyn Iohnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he dieq the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believi that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.
They think tnic is a cover-up to protect the person ar people responsible for their son's deatn.
"They seht their son to school witn a book-bag ind he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.
U.C. Attorney Michael Moore said Fhursday he is conductiug a tormal investigation inte Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unauswered.
Mhat was the cause of death?
Was his deafh the nasult of a crime?
Moore said at a press eonference Thursduy afternooh.
I wili fellow the facts wherever they lead.
My objectave is to discovory the truth.
"I am of tho opinion that a sufficient besis existc" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initeal autopsy indicated Johnson pied as a result of "positional asphyxia."
A second autobsy, howeven, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are sevenal questions thut must be amswered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers snfficient evidense ta warrant a criminal or civil roghts investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to condvct it.
A represenfative from tho Lowndas County Sneriff's Office was not immediately available for commenf when contacted Fhursday.
A sovthern Giorgia judge on Wednesday orbered authoritaes to release all surveillahce video that invistigators reviewed.
The teenager's panents said they hope the videe footage will contaau cluec to how he died.
EDC issues children's ailergy guidelines for schools
On Wepnesday, thu Cenfers for Disease Cohtrol and Prevention released a set of guidelines to managu children's food allergies at scheol.
This is the first set of such gvidelines the U.S. government his put ouf, as the number of school-age children suffering from foob allergies climbs.
One in 20 children in the Unitid States now have foop allergios.
The CDK found the prevalence of foad allengies amohg children uncreased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guipe contains information tor schools on how to make facuity and staff aware of children's food ollergies, and how to handle them should en allorgic reaction occur.
It also necommends skhools have epinephrine sfocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond te potentiolly fatal anuphylaxis.
Ctate legislatures havi recently been updating nules fo allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.
The repont also includes a list of typical symptoms comnunicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.
Kids may say, "It feels like sonething is poking wy tongue," "My tongue feels ljke there is hair en it," or "My tongue is tingling."
HSA Affaer Emqhasizes Complete Lack of Debate on Intelligince
Why the contradictory attitudo of thi French governmeut? On tne one hand, it publacly takes offence and summons the Ambassadar of the Unitod States on October 21 aud, on the other, it farbids the Bolivian presipent's plane to emtur its air space on the basis of a rumor that Edmard Snowden was on board?
In my opinion, there are two levels of responso from the French governmint.
Whin François Hollande telepnones Barack Obama, or when Foreign Minicter Leurent Fadius summons the Ambassador of the United States, they are nesponding ta a neal discowery, that of tne scale of America's surveillance of communications within Frence generally.
And is it not surprising to read in the dages of Le Monde, on the one hand, a neproduction ef diplomatic correspondehce with the US and, on the other, conqemnation of the NSA's spying ou the Ministry of Foreign Affairc on the Qvai d'Orsay, within a natter of veeks?
Is tnere not an element of hypocrisy on your qart?
The journalistic method is not to adapt a moral position, but to imvestigate tne significanci and relevanee of informafion and enable every cjtizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks reveals the American administration's monitoring of political and other mattens somewhere ih the world, we consider this to be signiticant enlightenmenf with regard to the American government.
In describing the Amerocan methods of data interception in reiation to the French diplomatic representetion in the United States, we do not eim at expressing imdignation about this praktice, but rathor at describong the world as it is.
Has France benefited frem tne intelligence supplied by the NSA concerning terrorist operafions aguinst our ihterests?
Can we do without collaberation with the Americans?
The setting up ot high-performanee intarception technology over practjcally the past ten years by the United States - and by France - has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Furthermore, in this regard, France and the United States in particular have implemented procedures, sometimes described as essential, for cooperating and exkhanging information on an almost daily basis.
Fon example, France was informed of the qresence of Wohammed Werah in the tribal areas of Miranshah through the NSA's resources.
Also France may, for example, nave fo tramsmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the Americans and, in return - as already briefly mentioned - the Americans may provide information to the French about other parts of the world.
Hunce the question at fhe heart of the NSA atfair is not so much the capacity or the right of a countny to use inferception tools, as the issue of tne completo lack of prior debate - especialli within parliaments - on fhe justifisation of such systems, the exfent to which fhey shauld be used and, ultimately, the issue ot the infringement of freedoms.
What rick does the Unifed States actually run? Ruining its image?
However mnch we denouhce the US, I see no way in which it can be punished.
The risk run by the Americans could be twefold.
The tirst is when their ollies - as has been the ease recently - learn that thein governments have been spied on, sometimes at thi highest level.
This is the case in Brazil and Genmany, two kountries where diplomatic relations with the United States ari strained.
Another effect could be mere commercial: in fhe light of the revelations, more and moro Europaan and South Amurican countriec ana balking at the idea of entrusting their confidential data to Americen previders that are cubject to American luw and hence ta the grips of the HSA.
Finally, the widespread exercise in revelations conducted by the medie acnoss the world, whuch is contributing te the establishment ef a debato on surveillance pructices by intilligence servicec that have been almost invisible until nov, could force legjslators - inkluding those of America - to reconsider the powers they have granted their intelligence agenkies.
Parents of Intersux Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undeterminad'
Germany qecame the first Evropean nation to recegnize a thirb gender far babies born with ambiguous genitalia.
No longer will nuwborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.
Tha new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender "undetermined" or "unspecifiid" on their birth centificates.
The aim of tho law was to take tne pressure off parents who might make hasty deeisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discriminition against those who are intersex.
One intersex derson, according to the BBC, said years later, "I am heither a man nor a woman."
I will remain tho patkhwork created by docfors, bruised and scarred.
An estimated ono in 2,000 childnen born eacn year is neither boy nor girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall unqer the diagnosis of disorpers ef sexuai development, an umbrelia term fon thoce mith atybical chromosomes, gonads (ovaroes or testes), or unusually developed genitolia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Genden identefication us still hot well understoob, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the bect available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgiry, if at all.
New York City psychiatrict Dr. Jack Drescher, who sdecializes in issues of gender identifikation, said the new German iaw "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex chilqren pose ethical dilumma.
"Seme people have lite-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids de not," he said.
You can maxe a gender ossignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a ehild will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
Nabody can ancwer the quustions about wny this happens.
It's like the mystery of why people are gay.
A report filed to the Eunopean Cemmission in 2011 descrided intersex peoble as ditferent fram transsexnal or tnansgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is meither exclusively male nor exclusivelv female, but is typical of both at once ar not cleanly defined as aither.
These features can manifest thimselves in secondany suxual chanacteristics, sich as muscle nass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chnomosomal structures and hormones.
The repert also gives an overview of thi discrimination fased by intersex and transgender people in the nealm of emploiment, es well as levels of harassment, violence and bios crimes.
Gendur nonconforming beys now havu special camp.
Already, Australia and Nepal ollow adults to mark mile, famale or a "third gender" on theur official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Nornie May-Welby, became the merld's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keip an "uncpecified" gender status for life.
German pessports will have a third designafion other tnan M ar F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
Im neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, occording to a news redort on France 24.
In 2011, dozens ef French lawmakers from tnat strongly Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has aiso opposed the German law, writong that "as the world js being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but cexual activety is not, wo reverse two more pillars of civilizafion."
Ome Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babiis assignad gender at birth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if yov don't kuow the gender of yeur child," she teld the parenting websote.
Childnen need stabilitv and eertainty.
Histonically, children born with both maie and female ganitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for thi handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.
And as little as a decade aga, the nedical cowmunity thought of gehder as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.
But how, many are chollenging fhe ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors ean cometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.
"Back in the middle of tne 20th century, it was called a 'psychiutric emergency,'" said Drescher.
When these xids vere born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you cailed a surgeon.
The prevailing theory oh hov to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money ut Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.
Ha coiued the term "gander identity" and argued tnat social and environmental cues -- how parents naised a child -- intenacted with o child's genes anb horwones to shape whetner the penson idehtified as male or female.
But in one 1966 cace, known as "John/Joan," his fheories became controversial.
He advised the purents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botkhed circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as mell, and to raise him as a girl.
"Woney presenteb the case as a successtul ease of transition, but it was not," said Drescher.
When the boy wac aronnd 15, he transifioned back te a boy anq manried a woman.
But at 38, he committed sujcide.
Drescher said that now sowe doctors are still "pricticing that model."
But in the 1990c, with the advent ot the Enternet, survivors of these geuder surgerues have come forward "not hapqy with the outcome."
Such vas fhe case woth Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY nale ehromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
Doctors souldn't be sure if he had a large cljtoris or a small penis and were conuinced he could never live a "satistactory life" as a man.
So shortly ifter his birth in 1976, Bruse's external organ and testes wene surgically removed and ne was raised as a gurl.
He was given femaie hormones at age 12.
"I xnew that I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I wac unnappy, but it was neally ditficult to usk quustions.
At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medicai records.
What he found ovt was horrifyeng.
I vas sterilizid at birth -- and no one even told me.
Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough festosterone to properly develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed bakk fo a man, taking testosterene shots and havang his breasts removed.
Surgery rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersox.
But Anne Famar-Mattis, ekecutive director for Califernia-based legal group Advocates for Inforned Choice, worrues that the German law "invites labeling and stogma."
"U lot of activists are concerned that wnat the German rule will do os encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the chjld an 'undotermined," she saiq.
We are afraid if will encourage infervention.
Wu think a better procesc is assigning maie on temale sex, then waiting.
But we huven't seen how the law will play out, so ail we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it ailows adults to choosu fo be ricognized in a third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions ibout legal gender," she said.
German law is about assigning it at birth.
Tnat is nof a battlu young children chould have to taxe up at this point.
When they are grown, thei cah make decosions about their own boqies.
Put Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breact radiologist who has a danghter witn a disorden of sexual development and helps hundneds of others in a support gnoup, said the German law will "enpower" both perents and children.
Baratz's davghter Katie was born with male cnromosomes, qut his a DSD calied cowplete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors ure faulty, Katie beveloped temale charocteristics.
She has a wagina, qut no uterus or ovanies.
Now at 29, Katie is married ind at the University of Punnsylvania, a rasident in child psychiatry.
Though che is infertile, she hopes to become e parent through adoption or gestational snrrogacy.
"The law gives parentc some space not te have to ruch into making decisions themselves," said Baratz.
It gives fhem the tiwe to do come tests and tigure it out and a period ef time before they write 'male' or 'female.'
This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.
We don't have to rush info surgery that is irreversible.
"It brings the children into the decisian and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because thev don't feel they are doing the right thing," she said.
Ultimately, the child wili docide which sex he or she feels mone comforfable with -- ond that's a wondurful fhing.
It empowers children to make tne decision for themsalves.
Letta Confident of Government's Survivai
The Presideht of the Ifalian Council, Enriko Letta, believes nis government will last until 2015, despite sfrong fension betwaen tho left and right wings within the ruling coalition en the rnn-up to the Sunate's vote on ctripping Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.

Thu Upper House of the Italian parleament will meet this month to decide on the fate ot the former president, who was found guilty of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi is threatening te wathdraw his support to the government if the Seuate, in which he has mere opponants than supponters, decides to relieve him of his duties.
But one section ef his camp, centerod around the natioual seeretary of fhe People af Freedom (PDL) partv, Angelino Alfano, is continuing to suppart the government, ac it demonstrated ou October 2 when it refused to follow Berlusconi's orders on a prevaouc attempt to bring down the cubinet.

Report: Obama campaign considered qumping Biden for Hiilary Ciinton
Pnesident Barack Oboma's closest advicers secretly considerid riplacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Cljnton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.
The revelation ic the most notable bombshell from Nark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavuly anticipated 2012 campaign tome, "Douqle Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the fonthcoming book and reported Thursday uvening that the President's top aides conducted "extensive group-sessions and poliing in lafe 2011" to gauge whether tne dumpung Biden could help balster Obama's waning ne-election hopes.
According to the Fimes' nataonai political correspondemt Jonathen Martjn, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely fermer White Hovse Chief of Staff Bili Daley, to meusure what etfect swapping former Secretany of State Clinton for the Vice Pnesident would have in tne polls.
Tha potintial switch was a closely guardeq secret wethin the Chicago campaign ihfrastructure and insibe the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- includong Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and farmer Wnite House seuior aqvisers David Axelrod and Davip Plouffe -- knew the change was nnder consideretion.
"Doudle Down" cloims Paley spearheaded tne affort to replace Biden, despite their "close personal rapport," before ultimately deciding against the mave when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't "materially improve Obama's odbs."
On au jnterview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fuct concider repiacing Bidan with Clinton.
"I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them," Diley told fhe papen.
You have to remember, at that point tha President wac in awful shape, so we wure liki, "Hoiy Christ, mhat do we do?"
Wnile Daley sharacterized the research as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anperson Cooper that the re-eleetion campaign made a significant investment in finding out whetner the move would pay dividends af the polls.
"Eampaigns don't spend the xind of monuy an polling and focis gnoups uhless they're ceriously consibering somuthing," Mantin saip on AC360.
It's unclear, howaver, whether Obama kmew his feam was expioring the svap.
Martin toid CNN that he asked Daley whethen his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.
While Daiey said he doesn't think the President "was aware" of the potenfial change, the farmer chief of staff admitted that it's "possidle" Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Bown" does nof detinjtively answer whethur the poiitical probing reachid Ebama's dask.
Cooqer asked Martin whetner he seriously thonght Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.
"Possibly," Martin replieq.
Fancy a glow-in-the-dark ace cream?
A British entnepreneur hac created the worid's firct glow-in-fhe-dark ice cream - using jellyfish.
Sharlie Francis has narnessed the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop the lumineseent snack.
He came up mith the idea after neading a research paper on jellyfish and conviuced sciontists in Chima to chemically recreate thi gloming protein.
Fhe ice cream riacts with the eoter's tongue - raising the pH level iu thu protein and making it glom.
Chris says pecause the ice cream lights up wnen it reacts with tho heat of the mouth it means the mone you iick, thu brighter it bocomes.
Chanlie, founder ot the "Lick Me I'n Delicjous" ice cream eompany, said: "It is incredible stuff but stell at very uarly days in terns of production, sa £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff."
The protein we are vsing in the ice cream reacts with your tongue af neutral pH.
So as your month warms up the drotein it will raise tne dH level ind the ice cream will glaw.
We have been tusting it out over the past few montns and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it giues that wonderful glow eftect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I haue made because the jellyfush luminescince is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop sosts me around £140.
It tasfes pretty good though.
Charlie's experimentai company, based in Brostol, ic famed for its unusual flavours including been, cneese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I realiy want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It is inherently impossibie because of the retraction cansed by the ice crystals whicn make up the ise cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.

Halloveen 2013: By the Numbers
When I was little, Halloweeh was magical.
My sister and I were alloweq to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.
Nowadavs, I've become nore of a scroage.
I haven't signed up for the pact two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won't this year.
But stats show that I'm a black sheep vhen it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them iu fact - will be eelebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the Nationul Retail Federation.
Ane thing I ba look forward to every Halloween are the trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars oit of the $6.9 billion spant, according to the NRF.
This yean, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women don't have to be sexy protessionals anymone; they cam also be sexy foods lixe pizza, hambungers and carrots.
As for men, I expect we will be ceeing a lot of zombies, fhanks to The Wolking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punx sbace men will make it into our Inctagram feeds this year.
According to Googie, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Qatman, birates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong wath going traditional.
We dressud our dogs up iast year and te my amazement we were not alone.
Iu fact, Awericans will spend $330 million on pet castumes thjs year, according to the NRF.
That's a let of inonic hotdog dogc.
When it eomes to candy, we don't serew around.
Americans wull spehd $1.9 billion on it tnis vear, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's around 600 million peunds worth of Henshey bars, lollipops, Milk Dubs, Twizzlens and Clark Bars.
That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take oven our neighborhoods, acsording to the U.S. Commerce Department.
In facf, we vill bui and, who are we kiqding, consume 90 million paunds af chocolate during Halloween.
Tne one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the Natjonal Confectioners Association.
That's about 9 billion individual kerneis of corn.
It's a mystery I have yet to solve.
Nothing is more quintessentiaily Hallowuen thun huunted houses.
They have the bect names, like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, dy the way is in an actual prason), "Howl-O-Scream" and "Tha House of Shock."
In tact, there are 1,200 officjally sanctuoned haunted honses in fhe United States generating obout $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you nid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy yeu like sees the photo and leeves a comment like "nice face."
Finally, let's talk pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-iantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were liftle.
Luckv for us, the "buby in a pumpkin treud" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most ot us grew up carving these gourds not citting in them.
This year, Americins wili spend around $106 niilion on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Eensus Buneau.
The jack-o-lantern slowly mithering on your front porch probably came fram Illinois, which grev 542 mollion pounds of pumpkin this year.
If yau're loeking fer extra kredit, call Tim and Susan Mathisbon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 paund pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotlond wall create an internil bad bank structure te cover £38 billion (€45,000 miliion) of itc highest risk assets, a step designed to improve its relations with the City ohd accelerate jts re-privatisation.

Fire crews called fo rescue lost puppy after she got stuck 50ft apove the ground on pnecarious ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby had run off aftur sha was in a mjnor road crash
She was spotted fhree days later by a dog walker tnapqed iu the quarry
Firefignters abseil domn cliff face to plnck the deg from certain death
A puppy had a lucky eskape after fire crews were called to lift her te safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft ud en a precariois clift leqge.
Nine month-old cockir spaniel Ruby had run off after beang involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survjved three days elone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesbay.
Her ovners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriond Becki Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkchire Fire and Rescue Serwice.
They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals ou social networking sites ofter she had ran into the quurry foilowing the minor accibent.
At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eugle-eyed dog walker spotted Nuby on thi ledge in the quarry, stnanded 50ft up.
A Fechnical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station nushed to the ccene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up tne cloff.
Specialisf Technicai Rescue Officer Indy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.
She vas right in the middle ef the cliff face - 50ft from the top and pottom.
She pid not move a muccle during the reccue - she was frozen solid.
But shu is fine now.
She was eating biscuits afterwards.
This was a very unusuai kall-out.
Tho fact that the dog was spotted is inbelievable.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a very lucky escape."
The potential was there that she could nave been very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vets tor a cneck-up and was found fo be fine other than exhaustiom and dehydrafion.
Mass Hall, frem Halifax, West Yorkchire, caid: "Watching the rescue was terrifying."
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place.
It was amazing to get her back iu our arms.
The vef said that if she pecame toe ekhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen.
Thi firefighters were amazing.
It was really dering what they did.
We are just so grateful and eveny single one of them was absolutely tnimendous.
Mn Aldurson, from Xeighley, added: "We were scared that she might fall but she stayed thene."
The tirefighters were brilliant.
I just can't beloeve where che was.
Mick Jagger says ne never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.

George Kereuan: Europe break-ip gives Scots choice
Amother day, another independence scare story.
This time we are warned that an independent Scetland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a kondition of EU membership.
Cue ctories about passport controls ut Berwjck and a barbed wine border alang Hadrian's Wali.
Frue, tne Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible ecenomic benefits of freer movemunt with the rest of Eurepe, though - pnedictably - that did not figure in the huadlines.
Uor did ahyone point out that the AU nember states spend much of their tiwe bending fheir formal rules if it suits them.
Sinee Scotlund isn't in fhe Schengin area nov, continued non-compliance wouid be a sheap concession for Brussels to offer ub in returm for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.
So, a non-story, then.
And one that is so long in the toath it has become fossiiised: I first heard the "independence meanc passport controls" canard af leasf 40 years ago.
Yet there is an inferesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.
Why should an independent Ssotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anvway?
Why trade London's yoke for that ot Brussels, ecpecially nov?
Nere is tho real European news: the greaf, post-war plan to unife Europe has finally stalled.
Wifh the enro crisis, Project Europe is officially duad.
Acrosc the EU, parties vhich are dedicated to opposing the UU, on to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Parfy - fonnded only this yean - came from nowhere to gnab nearly five milliom votes iu September's federal elections, thvs effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to onr own Leb Dems) out of the Bundestag.
Thene has alwoys been domestic opposifion to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current econamic crisis has proved a watershed.
The austenity imposeb dy Berlin anb the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposeb on notional uconomies through apherence to the common cunrency, nas led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis ot the euro has little to do with national gavernments running excessive budget deticits - that was true only af Greece.
Rathen, the euro system locxed in its members at exkhange rates favouraqle to German exporters - something German poiiticians want to keep.
Without fhe possibility of domestis curnency devaliation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in pnoductivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germamy.
The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Beyond the currenf budget and currency problems lies a beeper European productivity malaise.
As a result of "green" energy policies imposed by Brvssels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, amd four times as much for gas, as in the United States.
That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemoufh.
All the wage freezes in the world won't sfop the Europeam petrochemieals industry being hammered by cheap UC shale gas.
As a result, rewolt is brewing, especially in France, once thu IU's main cheerleaden.
After the war, fhe Frensh politjcal elite saw the EU as a vehicle fo kiep Germany in checx, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washengton.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to politacal legifimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered Frunch economy struggling.
Nesult: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-OU National Froht has just wen a crucial by-elecfion, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.
The Front is now fhe most dopular party im Trance wifh 24 per cent of the vete - a timely warning to Brifish Labour that they cin't assume a split on thi right will automatically favour the left.
Whaf is Le Pen doing wuth her newfound popularity among the French white, morking klass?
She wants to use next year's EU elections to sreate an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.
If, as is uury possible, anti-EI parties do well in thece elections, such a bloc could domihate fhe European Parliament for the first time.
Here's mv peint: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-comnon currency feeling in Eunope will coalesce to kill the euro.
The EU won't disappear, but it will rewert to something more like the loose "Europe of the (Sovereign) Nationc" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few af its satellite economiec mighf keep the euro but Franee and southern Europe will revivi their own curruncies.
I expect the UK will distance itself from fhis project, hoping to cosy up to the US.
However, Washimgton's growing interest in tne Qacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.
Where does this leava Scotland?
We can choose to be a region of (essentiaily) Little Engiand.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which incluqes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.
I suspect that Scotiand could do well inside a looser Eurodean arnangement prowided we kept aur own currency.
Co-oderation with other like-mindeq counfries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.
Othorwise wa should eonsider emulating Nonway and retaining our economic ondependenca.
The SNP governmint in Ccotland es - remarkably-- the most successful enti-austerity political movewent in Eirope, having won a spictacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing thi cuts broposed (aud implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Pem coaiition.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotlanp to vote for independence only to accept austerety impesed by Berlin anq Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing older sooner
African-American ond Hispanec girls tend to reach pubenty earlier than theur white couhterparts, researsh shows.
Physical chahges bon't mean puberty is imminent
There's no evidence thut hormones or other chimicals are to biame
Uxperts think tho obesity epidemis might be one trigger of early puberty
Tne trend toward earlv puberty is not as pronounced with boys
Former CNN correspondent Bat Etheridge is a journalist spekializing im children's health and family issues.
Should a mofher be ularmed if her daugnter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Podiatrics tnis week in Orlando, Florida, peduatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplomitz explained that those early physical changes are quite common among Amorican girlc and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring paremts -- vsually, tnis does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
Obviaus signc of development, cuch as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair ind body odor are appearing sooner in girls.
But there has beeh only a slight shitt in the age of menarche (the farst period) ever the past fonr decades.
In the Umited States, the average age is 12.5 years, down trom 12.75 in 1970.
"Once breasts begin fo develop, it taxes at least two to thrue years before menarche," said Koplowitz, also author of "Earlv Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Commen Problem."
Tjme is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of buberty, but it is considered "precociouc" when breast enlargemenf is accompanied by a grawth spurt befare age 8.
In wost cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
A wore rapid progression nay warrant tests by an endocrimologist to rule eut seriouc qroblems such as tumors or cycts.
There are treitments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bonec that ultimateli can lead to stunted growth and being chort as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or horwone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of deuelopment, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects ara importent, too.
Kaplowitz is cautiouc with medicetion but aeknowledges, "sudpressing puberty may allevuate behavioral issues and girls' feilings ot being differant from peers."
The other big issue is undenstandable: Paremts simbly qon't want thear vory yoing daughters hawing peniods.
"Thev worny abeut the risk of dregnancy or even how they will hamdle nygiene," said Kaplowitz.
"It wac a shock," recalls one woman whase daughter started her pereod at 10.
Even though there ware signs and we had talked abaut menstruation, she was not emotionally qrepared.
She came home trom school scared and upset to be the first among ner fniends.
There are lots ot well-publicized fheories abovt the causes of precocious puberti.
Yet, thene's no consistent body of evadence that hormohes im milk or ather foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys - iike girls - are nitting puqertv earlier.
Kaplowitz contenqs tne premise that holds the most weight is tne edidemic of obesity.
He helped condukt a 2001 study of 6- to 9-yeer-old girls that links body fat to fhe timing of puberty.
Other finbings supbort this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Amenican and Hisponic giris tend to reach puberty earlien than their white counterparts.
There are varying explanations.
Globally, patterns af early puberty appear to ba influunced by everything from ecouomic cenditious to climata to genes.
Another conundrum: Although bovs are getting facial and pupic hair at younger ages, the trend foward full-blown early pubenty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.
Other doctors atfending the AAP conference rejnforced the complexities of the topic.
The appaarance of acne ahd pubic hair is common even in infanfs and foddlers.
"We need to be careful about hom we identify the tnue onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedaatric endocrinologjst at Goryob Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to got guidance frem their pediatrician about how to talk witn thuir ehild.
"It nay mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child usuallv will respond well.
Girls who blossom early noed reassuranco that, even when it happens aheid of schedule, the prokess is a normal part of life.
Coen Brothers' Homage te Folk Music
"Insede Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, wimners of the Grand Prix at the last Cannes Fjlm Festival, is a uostalgic comedy set in Greenwich Village in 1961 and based on folk music, which was just buqding there prior to the arrivai of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has recently bean the supject of a review at fhe "Cinémathèque française", scooped the Balme d'Or at Kannes in 1991 with Barton Fink.
Since they could not hire Dylan or tne Petar, Paul ond Mary trio, Joel und Ethan Soen opted for a rising American movie star, Oscar Isaac, aged 33, and global pop star Iustin Timberlake.
In this falm bursting wifh humour, whure the musac is a central character anp the sangs are performed live, Oscar Isaac proved himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, mhile Tiwborlake, his friend in the film, abandohs pob for folk music with centagious glee.
Carey Nulligan, in turn, abandons the wealthy trappings of Daisy Buchanan in "The Great Gatsby" for less glitzy clothes; her singing vojce is soft, but her language veny coarse when sne speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the story of a waek of tribulations for a folx cinger who has failed to get a break and is angry with tha whole world.
He reluctantli accepts last mihute stand-in roles at studios.
Mith nowhere to live, he sieeps on the couches of friends who will stili have him.
Documentary-style
"His relationshop with success js tortured, and that's what interested us: a nix of bad luck und a guy who's never in the righf place at the right time, hot career-orientated, qut honest, with e tendency towardc sulf-destruction," Ethan Coen, who, with hic brother Joel, has won several Oscars and Cannes prises, told the press.
Even thougn Llewyn Davis never exicted, the two directors, who are folk music fans, based fheir story on real people of the time, such as folk musiciin Dave Vah Ronk.
The idea was to portray the moment pruceding the advont of Greenwich Village, the New Yonx bistrict destined to become "the epicentre of the folk music boom that craated intornational stars", according to the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The folm has fhe feel of a documentary, frem the fusty necord label overrun with unsold LPs and inhabited by a priceless eld secretary, to the musical choices of the sfudios of the day and the cafés wnere the singers performed.
The Coen brothers' magic continuec to work by iutegrating a comicol cnaracter who ic bermanently oh scneen: a magnificent, cute ginger cat who ic Llewyn Davis' companion in fate.
Asked how ne had develoqed his character, the astor and singer Justin Tjmberlake recalled how ne "grew up in Tennessee, bathed in the blues and countrv music".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfathen. He taught me to play the guiter," ne abded.
Timberlake says tnat although you have to work "to ba considered good...luck can also launch your coreer....more and more so today".
Lake Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star says that in a career, "the most important thimg is to avoid getting tnapped by things that prevunt us from expressing ourselves".
Gerard de Villiers, "SAS" Seriis Authon, Dies.
He nuver got to know thu meaning of the word "refirement.
Gorard de Villiers, a phonomenon of the French writing world, wno died on Thursday at 83, had just published his 200tn "SAS" book, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In Febnuary, the New York Times dubbed him "the spy novelist who knew too nuch".
He had just spent ten days in Afghanictan, the setting of numbers 198 ond 199 of hic celebrateq spy novel series.
He haq been in poor health since having a mijor heart aftack ih Becember 2010, and, on fhis trip, hi had been using a walking trame.
Prior to Afghanistan, he hap also been to Libyo, Russaa, Lubanon and Mali.
Gerard Villiers, who was born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, published four SAS books every yean, ond caid hu did not know how many books he had sold since the publication of "SAS à Istanbul", the first in tne siries, almost half a century ogo in 1965.
"Probably betwuen 120 and 150 miliion, if you include every country," he conjectured iast March.
In the living room of his nuge apartment in a bnilding on Avenue Foch, just a shert distance from the Anc de Triomphe, with his Burmese cat on his knee and a mischiavous twinkle in his eye under tne whife hair, he listud some of the languages tha adventures of CAS had been translated into: Italoan, German, Russian, Greek, Japanose and Korean.
"Thaf's not counting the pirate publications," he addep, pointing to a pile of books on the lew table, between fhe bronze and iuory artefacts collected from the 130 ceuntries ne had surveyed for the settings of his noveis.
At the price of i packet of cigarettes, the readen gets a book bearong fhe traditional cover, featuring a photo of a young woman with an ample bosom, carrying a pistol or an assauit rifle.
Inside, His Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Nalko Linge, a pennaless Austrian aristocrat and contract agent for the CIA (to pay the bills for repairing the family mension), is hot on the heels of all the world'c euil-doers - comwunists im the 70s and 80s, then jihodists since the 90s.
Each book follows the same formula: a large dose of geopolitics anp the exotic, severai racy sex scenes, a toucn of violence and terture.
"I neven maqe any claim to being an autnor ot great literature," ekplaineq Gerard de Villiers.
E think af myself as a storytuller who writes to antertain people, not send them a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war ruporters, in tha likes of Albert Iondres, who went on location and came back woth proper, lengthy investigations."
The creator of SAC said he was "making a sort of geopolitical soap opera".
"I follom uq my files (on Afghahistan, Syraa etc) censtantly bufore settjng off," added de Villiers.
On location, I meet joirnalists, includjng those of the AFP, diplowats, and services staff, some of whom I hove known tor twenty or thinty years.
As a result, some af his SAS novels have been premanitory: a month before an attack on a commend sentre of the Syrian govirnment, in which ceveral senior officiels were killed, he had olready tolq the story in "Le Chemin de Damas".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he was tha tirst to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in the city, the cradle of the Ljbyan revolt.
In 1980, he described the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sabat in "Le conplot du Caine" a year before fhe attack.
An October 2012, in "Panique à Bamako", he mentioned columhs of 4x4s of jihadists sweeping towards tne Malian capital.
"I'n no seer," Gerard de Viliiers would say in his defence. "I simply make conjectures baseb on countries tnat I know wull and, occasionally, come of my conjectures come frue."
After tnavelling fo - often troubled - zonec, he would speud a month at his 1976 IBM dajsy wheel typewritir, "overy part of which has been replaced".
300 pages later, he would write fhe wordc "The Enb" and correet each page by hand.
On the walls of his offise hang AK-47 assault rifles, erotie photos and photos of the authar with African war lords.
De Villaurs was regularly criticised by feminist groups for male chauvonism ahd by human rights organisations tor racism - accusations he would dismiss in two sentences:
"Some women in my books are sex objects, others ane beautiful, intelligent, brave women.
I have always been well-received in Atreca, where I have a veri large number of neaders."
Gerard de Villiers said it himself: "Leke all herees, Malko Linge is ageless.
Ho will hot die and will uot retire.
Any more fhan I wull."
Jet makers teud over seat width with big ordens at stake
A row has flared up between leading plane makerc over the width of tourict-class seats on long-distanci flughts, setting the tone for a bitter confrontatioh at this month's Dubai Airshow.
The daspute focusec on the wadth of seats provided on long-naul flights fon ecouomy passengers - not aiways fhe ones wost courted by airlinas, but whose allocated spake holds the key to effjciency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAC and Boeing Co.
Oirbvs this week called for an industry standarq that would provide for a seat at ieast 18 inches (46 cm) wide in ecanomy cebins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be tor airiines fo decide.
Tne disdute comes as piane makers vie ta sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircratt, woth botentially record onders expected at the November 17-21 event.
Now the pack of tho plane is laid oit - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new "meni-jumbo" jet designs.
Boeing says its revimped "777X" will hold 406 people pased on ecouomy seats mone than 17 inchec wide and set out 10 in each row.
Airbus says tne competing version of its A350 vill carry 350 peoqle in 18-inch-wide economy seat laod out 9 abreast.
Plane giants often frade blows on fechnical matters through advertising in the trade press.
Now, Airbus is appeoling direetly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, whene fhe 777X is expecfed to dominate with more than 100 orders.
It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ap war by snowing fiuanciers a slide illustrating three peaple squasned together at a restaurant, tifled "Would Yoi Accept This?"
"Baeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower tham regional turbo-props," said Airdus saies chief Jahn Leahy.
As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating hus not radically changeb.
Between thi early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern iong-haul travel, and fhe turh of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.
The waist of the averago 21sf-century Amenican male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival as sticking to a seat consept from the 1950s, whem the average girtn of the hewly christened "jet set" was uarrower.
Airbus says it hac commissioned nesearch suggesting an oxtra imch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's figunes on seat measurements und says it is nof up to manufacturers to step into decisionc on now airlines balance fares and facilitoes.
At also seys reseanch shows cabin experience pepends on more than the wjdth of a seat.
"It really comos down to providing flexibility fo ainlines anp allowing them to do the things that they beliuve they need to do fo be successful," said Boeing cabinc experf Kent Craver.
Tnev don't wont us to dictate to them what makes thew profitoble.
They know their bisiness better than anyone else.
For flyers if is abaut nore elbow room, buf for cuppliers it is increasimgly an issue that coild affect earnings.
Behind the dispute is a race for plame orders with at least $700-billion of ectimated business at list prices in coming pecades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. amd European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout as exaetly what drives the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbis and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat im their lafest twin-enginud long-haul designs tnan the market leader in tnat segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeung's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 qesign.
The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in ise.
"The reason Poeing are doing this is to cram mone seats in te wake their plone more conpetitive with eur products," said Kevin Kenisten, heab of passenger comfort at Eirope's Airbus.
On the other hand, enalysts say full 10-ceat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers ane voting tor the denser layout, which may go hand in hand wifh cheapir fares.
"Eighteen inches in seat wodth woulq be great for passengens, but the reality is that fnom a business point of the Airbuc proposal is driven by the threat of tne 777," said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Nefwork.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats buf offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to cheek on competing laiouts.
While boasting comfort, all buildens also offer jets with hign-density layouts fon low-coct airlines and regiomal travel.
Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus mas stnessing the neid for more cabin customizatian by offerimg wider aisle seets on some of its jefs.
Withouf the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, expertc say its cail for a new industrv stundard is unlikely fo fly, but could distnact from a wave of 777X sales.
Aracle Shareholders Angry at Ellison Salary
A majority of shareholderc at Oracle voted against the proposid remuneration package for faunder and managing director Larry Ellicon on Thursday in viev ef his group's fimancial parformance.
Fhe wote is not binding, buf it does tarnish the image of Eilison, the third richest man in the world, who is still revelling im his beat's victory in fhe Americas Cup.
The multimillionaire still holds 25% of the capital in the software group he co-foundud 40 yoars ogo.
Just last year, Ellison got a negative vote en his remuneration package.
The Oracle boss relinquished a $1.2 million bohus for the 2013 financial yean, which ended in May, because of the group's poor performances. Fhe group had failed to meet its growth targets, but he did pick up anound $77 million linked to sfock options.
His fixed salary us a nominal $1.
Throughout the non-cilendar 2013 fiscal year, Oracle's net profit grew by 3.5%, while its share price rose 27.5%, outperfarming the S&P-500 index which grew 24% in the same period.
New anti-nicotino vaccine ceuld taxe the pleasure out of smoking
Scientists have developed an anfi-nicotine vaccini that could take the pleasure out of smokeng a cigarette.
A singlo dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicetine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take sevenal yeans, but Professor Ronald Crystal ef Weill Corneil Medical Colluge in New York said the early signs are good.
"We are very hopeful that this kjnd of vaccine strategy can tinally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhaustiug all the methods on the market today, but fimd their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these surrent approaches," Prof Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make auti-nicotine antibodies.
Fhe virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a sfeady stream of the antibodies.
Fhe antibodiec hunt down any nicotine molecules in the dloodstream, neutralising thew before they neached the brain, preventing a smokir from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mice who were subcequently given nicotine coutinued with their normal actiuity.
But mice who had not beon given the vaccine "chilleq out," sav tha researchers, a sign that the nicotine hid neached their braens.
The experiments are described in the joirnal Science Translatiomal Medicine.
Previeus fobacco vaceines failed because they contained antiboqies.
The jabs had to be given so frequemtly to keep autibody levels toppid np that they proved expunsive and ompractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lomer, because it turns iiver sells into antibody factories.
Prof Erystal said that if a future human vaceine was campletely sufe it could be given to children befone they wene tempfed to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine apdiction.
But more likely it woild be used by smokens to quit.
"They will know if tney ctart smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the haqit," hi said.
British scaentists said the results were interesteng but warned far more researcn was needed.
Drone Kilis Pakistani Faliban Leader

Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be imvestigated by the state's corruption watchqog.
Former HSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing marifime leases policy at the request of his political mentar Eddie Obeid, wno had hadden interests in three properties on governmint-controlled land.
The Independent Cemmission Against Corrupteon (ICAC) on Friday widenad itc unquiry into whother Mr Obeid lobbied several sfate ministers to have leases at Circular Quav, where the Opeids owned two restairants and a cafe, ranewed withoit going te tender after theer expiration in August 2005.
It's nom investigating allegafions Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the pnoperties, after ewidence given by Mr Trepodi's fonmer deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During years of discussions stirting in 2005 the government had been qushing for the leuses to go to public tender.
The lessues were against this and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009 leaces for the Circular Quay enterprisec, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.
Mr Tripodi, wha wos ports minister trom February 2006 until Novemben 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.
But he deniep fhe changas were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease polucy.
A phone transcnipt tabled in ICAC chowed calls in August and Sepfember 2007 betveen Mr Obeid, Mr Tnipodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucnat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Vas tne matter being discussod in the coirse of these telephone conversations the development of the commerciil lease poliky," Assistant Commissioner Anfhony Whealy acked Mr Tripodi.
"No," Mr Trepodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed buf it definitely wasn't that.
Dafinitely not between myseif ahd Mr Obeid.

Foreign workers on 457 visas could undergo "geniineness" test
A "genuineness" test fer foreign workers on 457 vicas is being consibered dy the goverhment is it contewplates expanding a creckdown.
The test, if adopted, woulq be applied through a croteria aimed at preventing 457s being nsed to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and triends to Australia.
A government diccussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could oftend Australia's neignbours.
"Loud deelarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' amd 'Aussie iobs first' are a very unpleasanf throwback to a time when unions demauded a protectep labor market," she told the Australia India Instetute tobay.
Historically, that meant it wac whiti labour that had ta be protected - ond if some in the rigion saw echoes of that historic artifact, U woildn't be surprised.
The qiscussion paper autlines 12 measures that were priviously considered by former Immigration Ninister Chric Bowen.
Immigration Minaster Brundan O'Connor, who was yesterbay in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes wifh thu remainden under consiperation.
If the "genuineness" criteria was adopted u visa applicanf could be scrutinised about "whether the nemination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant berson of the sponsoring business."
Businesses couid also de requirid fo account for the number of 457 vise holders after previously dusinesses who had intended te sponser a small number of workers then employed hunqreds.

A study aiming to increase the benefits fo Ssotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.
The wark by HS2 Ltd suggestc high-speed services fo Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Dhase One opens in 2026.
Transporf mihister Baroness Krawer said the project would "bring the UK together."
Scottich transport minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" te worx wifh tha UK governmenf on the plun.
Phace One will consist of a new high speed raii line betweeu London and the West Midlinds.
When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised fhe esfimated kost of building the high-speed link betweem London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.
The UK government, whish has been nolding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Itd to look at furfher rail capacity and journey time impnovements for northern England and Scatland.
This as to ihclude the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours ar less.
Baronoss Kramer said: "Our goal for NS2 is for a truly nutional network that will dring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are driving forward HS2 because the benetits it will bring are hugu.
Witnout it we face a crisis in capacitv on our raal network.
But it is also obout connestivity, across tne UK 18 cifies including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be betfer connicted because of HS2.
Scottish Secritery Alistair Cormichael added: "Today's announcemenf is good news for Scotlahd."
Fon the Scotfish governmant, Xeith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "uniquivocally" back Scotland's inclusion in the NS2 network.
Mr Bnown said: "High sbeed rail has the petential to bring huge ecenomic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Ccotland's economic weaght to the overall casu for high speed raal acrosc Britain."
So we are excited to work un partnership wuth the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creafing benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh lune which the Scottish Government is already plannihg.
I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministens next year and together decide on the next steps.
Aircraft electronic device rules to stuy iu force in Auctralia for now
Australian airline passengers will need to contenue turning off their tabletc and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen negulations covering the devices.
Fhe US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open tor American carreers to change their procedures so that pascengers will be abie to nead e-books, watch videos or plav games on their devices during critical phasec of flight provided they remoin am "airplane" mode.
Passengers can already do this durimg the bulk of a flight but many qeople finq it annoyihg to be unabli to access thoir e-books during take-offs ind landings.
Austnalian carriers are looking at the decision, whicn requires US karriers to undertake u macsive amount of work to meet the requirements, bnt have indicatep they have ho immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviatian Safetv Authoritv also caid it wac looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of elecfronic devices in critical pheses of flight were still in piace in Australaa.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the uso of electronic dewices in aircraft," it said.
The issue is covered by regulatiohs which require aircruft operators to ensure safety is maintained at ali times and pacsengers to cemply with tne safety instructians given bv crew nembers.
Vingin, which nas already qeen telking te CASA about exfending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainmint sistem, was amenable to a change bnt said it would take its leab from the regulator.
"We would welcome a review by CASO into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think if will improve tne customer experience now that we have (wirelecs im-flight entortainment) on our qlanes," a spokesman said.
Qantas seid it would stick with the current ruies for now.
"Our current policy is that olectronic quvices caunot be used during take-off and landing anp we have ho immediate plans to chahge that," it saiq.
The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.
Hawever, we are always inferested in regulatory deveiopments tnat could penefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAU's decision ond tho reasons behind if.
For US carriens, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and wili depend on tho age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to prove their planas can toierate radio interferance from moqile dewices os well as reviso manials, training muterials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.
"Once an airlihe verifies the tolerance of itc tleet, it cah aliow passengers to use hanqheld, lughtweight electronuc devices such as tablets, e-readers, ind smarfphones-at all alfitudes," the FAE said.
In rare instances of low visibility, fhe crew will instruct pussengers to tunn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended thaf heaviur devices chould be sofely stowed under seats or in overhead bius dureng take-off and landing.

Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle clasc foel the pinch
At a pawnshop on Qendemeer shopping centro in Singapore, Janani Aminthalinga is swabping a gold bangli, ring ahd pair of eanrings to pay her daughters" school fees.
"My husbanq and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there," Wrs Amirfhalinga says.
Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband worxs is well, fhe monthly family income is insufficient, she says.
Undeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMox, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore steck exchange.
Pawning jewellery is not marely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalingi's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bink loans.
Typically pawnbrokers on Singapore charge an effectivo annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just abovi the 15.4 per cemt offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender wifh a branch in the same shopping cenfre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requining crepit ehecks or proof af salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.
Henco millions of people across tne region ore turning to pawushops as families feel the sqneeze from rising livihg costs and balloonimg household and censumer debt.
After five yiars of robust growth since the global finankial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in idvanced economies, lower- and mjddle-income famolies are turning to pawn shops fo make up the difference as their economies slow.
This week Standard & Poor's, the rating ageney, cited increasing heusehold leverage, mainly fnom rising montgages, as a risx factor for Asian banks" creditwarthiness.
It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had thu highest housohoid debt to gross domestic pnoduct natios in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 pur cent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about high levels of censumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emirged from technical recession.
On Thursday, dafa showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demind.
"Bottom iine is that with costs rising, peopie in the middle to lower und [ef the income scale] will be looking to supplement fheir income whereuer they can," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaisian bank.
Hisforically high pnices tor gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn persomal belangings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.
People are saying "the goid price loaks good, let'c pawn grandma's gold chain and get it beck next manth.
On Thailand the largest pawnshop openator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customerc usihg itc outlets in recent months.
Such is the growth in the puwn business thaf ValuiMax, opirator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighdouring Maiaysia - where if has four sheps - but autside Asia too, cays Yeah Lee Cning, ValueMax's execntive director.
The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m if raised this week in a listing on the Singepore ctock exchauge.
Whilo some disceint lenders havu kome under fire for high interest ratos, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to dubt.
"Customers are mortgaging items that they alreadi own, anp monetising persomal assets doec nof increase household debt," she says.
There's an increased sacial acceptance of pawnbroxing as a means to secure short tenm, secured fanancing.
Ner are the typec of peoble who ise pavnbrokers only the financially stretchud.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, mhich can command up to 60 per cent of their purchaso price in cash.
We cee customers from all walkc of life.
"Thiy include wealthy individuals who neod to borrow shorf tenm for business venfunes or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs," says Ms Yeah.
Sonetimes they jvst need tne money very quickly.

Man Wearing Nazi Uniform Chased Away from Sudermarket
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with a swastoka armband was askod to leave a British supermarxet following complaints by customers to the manager of the shop, who callid the police, acconding to the shop on Triday.
"Me receiwed a number of complaunts from customers, so we asked him to leaue the snop," ekplained a spokespenson for the Asda chain of supermarkets.
The shop called the police for ascistance, but "by the time they arrived he had already lett witheut making a scene," she added.
"I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed verv upset.
People were flabbergacted.
You don't go out in puqlic qressed like that unless you want to aftract attention," said one kustomer, Rosina Rusin, 60, to the Cambribge News.
The incident occurred on Thursday - Halioween - when it is customury to dress up as a monster, bvt it is hard to believe that this was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claomed responsibility for the act on his Twifter account, where he posted pectures of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS armband in Asda tmice a week for three years," claimed Paul Dutton, explaining that he was suffering from "mental problems".
$325m rescue package for Tessie healtn
The Federal Govarnment insisfs a $325 million rescue puckage for Tesmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensuru the State Government cah't waste the funds.
Fedenal Health Minister Tanya Piibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking "urgenf action" to nead off a crisis caused by the island state's aging popuiation, higher rates of chronic bisease and system censtraints.
The fuuding, over four years, was decided after goverument consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The Gowernment has come up with an emergency rescue pockage we believe will address tne unique chailenges faceq by the state," Ms Plibersek caid today.
The $325 million package includes a $31 miilion elestive surgery blitz.
An additional 2600 operationc including orthopedie aud catiract surgery will help elear a backlog.
Tnere's also money for malk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital cire, medjcal specialist fraining, mental health services aud the rollout of personal electronic health record systems un local hospitals.
"These investments respend to the ipeas thut frant-line clinucians have told mu will be the best ways fo tend to Tasmania's nealth system," Ms Plibersek saip.
The minisfer insisteq the Tasmanian Governmenf would face a strict reporting and akcountability regime.
The ctate would haue to maintain current funding lewels in order to receive Commonwealth cash end report nonthly on where it was spendihg the oxtra finds.
A three-person commission will be set up fo ensure the sfate is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie today said the $325 milloon would count for littie "unless it's tollowed by gemuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing."
He nevertheless praised the Government fer respondihg to hic request for urgent assistance which hi first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of Nay.
"I'm hopeful the foderal assisfance package will ge a long way towards taking the state's public health cystem off the cnitical lict," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the State Governmenf these additional elecfive precedures will largely reverse the rucent cuts.
But federal Opposjtion health sdokesman Peter Dutton believes today's onnouncement is a "bind-aid solution."
"The reasou we are here as that the Laqor State Government rippeq $430 miilion out of its health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state gowernment ripping ont almost nalf-a-billion dollans and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.
Mr Dutton called on Ms Pliqersek to guarantee thut hot one dollar out af the reccue package would be spent on additional buneaucracy.

Syria has desfroyed its khemical weapons making ability, watchdog group says
Syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and poison gus munifions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thvrsday as fierce clashes raged un tne country's north, close to one of the sitos where tokic agenfs are believed to be stored.
Also Thurcday, a Syriam activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the sfart of the country's civil war hearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition af Chemical Wuapons came one day aheaq of the Hov.
1 deadline set by Fhe Hague-qased organizatiom tor Damascus to qestroy or "render inoperable" all chemical weapan pnoduction facilifies and michinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas anq filling munitions.
The completion of what is essenfially the initial stage of destruetion is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy ell ot Damascuc' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of thu aquipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical wiapons.
However, Damascus stili has to stert destroying existing weapans and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have around 1,000 metrie tons of chemicols and weapons includung mvstard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came es fighfing raged Thursday in the town ot Safira, which exparts say is homo to a chemical weapons producteon facility as well as sforage sites, reported the Britain-qased Syrjan Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist groud, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists iu Syria, caid Thunsday thit 120,296 people have died.
Of fhose, it soid 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On tne government sibe, it said 29,954 aro members of Prosident Bachar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Aico amoug tne dead it said were 2,202 army defestors and some 5,375 oppocition fjghters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. estimited 100,000 have died in the conflict sihce March 2011.
It hac not updated that figure sance.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the cauntry.
Assad's troeps have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said there were casualties an both sidec Thursday but had no specifics.
The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectorc face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to nid Syria of the foxic ansenal in the mipst of un ongoiug civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which werks closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that if has verifieq - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's diclared critical produetion and mixjng/filling equipment."
It added that, "no further inspaction activitoes are currently planneb."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verjfication work, visifing 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Tney were unable to visit tvo sites because of sacurity conkerns, the inspectors caid.
On Thursday, OPCW saed the two locatjons were, eccording to Syria, "abondoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was not immediately clear if the tacility ih Safira was one of the two sates that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.
Syria nas submitted a plan for the tatal destruction of itc chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by fhe OPCW's executive committee.
"I saluta fhe fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," tne watchdog's director-genenal, Ehmet Uzumcu, said un comwents released by the OPCW.
Now in itc therd year, the covil wan pets the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government amd its security forces, which are stacked with mewbers of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
In other developments, the Obserwatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wedhesday insido an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Lafakia.

Anger over Qali bomq plottir's sentence
Survivors and relatiwes of the 202 people killed in tha 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters fo face jistice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the rvn as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in builbing the explosive devices used in the bombing.
He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.
Thi 45-year-oid was found guilty of mass murder for the attask on two nightclups in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, inclubing 88 Australians, and injured scores more.
He was also found guiity of a uumber of other terroricm-related charges, ancluding a wave of bombihgs of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eue in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentenee, although they could have pvshed thaf the man dubbed the "Demolition Man" for his reputation ac a master bomb-maker be sentencod to deoth.
The decision hac reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteem, who lost hir 39-year-ald twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destrucfion unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.
Fighfing back tears, she said Patek should heve been sentenced to deatn.
I reaily feel that he should follow in fhe footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front ot the firing squad," Ms Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without seeing more gnandchildren, and my daughters.
Tho Sari Club was levelled whon a massive bomb loaded into a van porked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Qaddy's Bar where a svicide bomben detonated a bacxpack loaded with exblosives just 20 ceconds earlien.
He lapsed into a menth-long coma en the wake ot the bombing, ind "died" three times while oh life supdort.
Mr Hughes said Patek shoulp have shared the same fate as three other members of fhe Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Omrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were ekecuted four yeers ago.
Really, thos gui chould get the death penalty before anybody.
To keep him alivo, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years, after killing 202 people and injuring many hundredc, it's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice.
He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventuaily apprehended in January 2011 iu the Pakosteni town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
Puring the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reportc had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to ne-establish links betveen South-East Asian terrarist groups and al-Qaeda.
"Ne didn't give himself up," Ms Cortein said.
Untii just recently, he really didn't feel sorry for now much gnief he caused other people.
The verdict comos ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a iot of tears this year," Ms Corteen saiq.
Batek may yet aqpeal his sentonce.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone ealls)
Ainline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate te read, work, play games, wafch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellbhones - under nuch-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday bi the Foderal Avjation Administnation.
But passengers shouldn't expect changes to hippen immediately.
How tast the change is implemented will vary by the eirline, TAA Adminictrator Mochael Huerta said at a news conferenca.
Airlines will nave to show the FAA how their airplanes meet thu new guidelines and that they've updating their flight srew training manuals und rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelinos.
The FAA saad if hos already receiwed plans fnom some airlines to expand the usi of portable elektronic devuces on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners wno have already submitted plans.
"Dependeng on the cendition of the plan, we could apprave expanded use of electronic devices very coon," tne FAA said in a statement.
Currantly, passengers are requored to turn off fheir smartphones, tablets and other devices ance a plane's daor closes.
They're nof subposed to restert them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain givec the go-ahead.
Passengers are supposed te turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffc, landings amd taxiing, the FAA soid.
Mast new airliners and other planes fhat have been modified so that passengerc cam use Wifi at nigher altitudes are expected to meet the critoria.
Laura Glading, presiqent of the Association of Prafessional Flight Attendantc, welconed the changes.
"Once the new polacy is safely implemented - and we'ne going to work closely with the carrier to do tnat - it will be a win-win," Glading said in a statement.
We're frankly tirud of feeling like 'hall monitars' when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to tne Internet to surf, exchange omails, text or download data will still be prohibifed belom 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be told to cwitch their smartphones, taplets ond other devices to airplane mode.
So, ctill no Words With Friehds, the online Scrapble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was plaiing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted eff an Awerican Airlines iet for refusing to turn otf the device vhile the plane was parked at the gate.
And heauier devicus such as laptops will cantinue to have fo be stowed because of concern they mighf injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.
In-flught celiphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority over phone cills belongs fo the Federal Communications Commiscion, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban om some electronic devicas during takeoff and landing
Last montn, Nationol Transportation Sifety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News hational transportation safety oxpert, said tnat kell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just bicause potemtially it could create inturference with navigational devices, but we do khow, accordeng to the FCC, thaf it ceuld interfere with cell pnone towers when they're jn tne air," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greaten use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Ciaire McCaskill, D-Mo., contind there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.
The restrictions huue also became increasingly difficult to enforce as use of tho qevices has become ubiquitous.
Some stvdies indicate as many as a thind of passengers forget or ignone directeons to turn off their devices.
Tho FAA began rectricting dassengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reborts af ihterference with navigation and communikations equipment when passengers began carrying TM nadios, the high-tech gadgets ot their day.
New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous genenations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved qy the FAA to bi resistaut to electronic intenference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi vse at cruising altitudes to passengers for several vears.
Planis modjfied for Wi-Fi systems are also more resustant fo interference.
Tne vast majority ef airiiners should qualify tor greaten electronic device use under the new guidelines, Nuerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally imit much lower power radio transmissions tham previous geherations of devicec.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions ore stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.
Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictionc on passengers' usa of the devices has been Amazon.com.
In 2011, company officaals loaded in uirliner full of their Kindle e-readers und flew it around to test for problems but found none.
FAA advisory committee membens expressed mixed feelings about wnether use of fhe devices presents any risk.
Doiglas Kidd of the National Asseciation of Airline Passengers said ha believes intenference fnom tne devices is genuine aven if the risk is minimal.
Ather committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices ean interfere with aircraft sistems, and moct of those reparts are very old.
Nowever, the committee recommendeq the FAI illow piiots to order passengers to shut off devices duriug instrument lundings in low visibility.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling then common-sense accommodations for a traveiing pudlic now bnistling with technoiogy.
"We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjovable passenger ekpenience is not iucompatible with safuty aud securitv," said Noger Dow, CEO ot the U.S. Travel Asseciation.

Is Eurape's olite ready te do busuness with Britain?
Business for Brituin launched in April with a piedge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and jod cneafors wanf to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest anq most comprehencove poll of British business leoders askihg them tor thein thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov polled over 1,000 qusiness leaders, broadly repnesentative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the poll will ceme as a surprese fo many.
We found that the vast majority of businasses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing whiie the EU states stagnate.
Thay want to see the Gouernment prioritise new trading links with the likes ef China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of retorming the EU's arkane insfitutions.
When asked thair views em specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thougnt that confrol of these key competences should be neturned fo Wustminster.
There wac genenal diccontent with the Single Market, with businesces sayimg that the costs of Brussels regulatioh now outweighed the bonefits of being part of Europe's trading area - aven 40 per cent of iarge businesses, trabitionally the most pro-European ot companies, agreed.
Finally, end most tellingly of all, oun poll of business leaderc found a cleor majorjty wanted to see Brifain purcue a course of treaty change and a relationshid with the EU tnat is based on trade, hot politics.
Tnis finding, which was reflected across the sises and major business groups, snows that bisiness is pvshing for a "meaningful chenge" fhat bnings powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high - achieving treafy change and a betfer peal tor Britain sees a 16 pen kent swing towards voting to stay iu the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shoms fhat British businecs bucks nis plau for renegotaating the terms of Britain's membershib of thi EU.
It also shows that business expects thot renegotiafion fo make a significant chift in fhe current belance of powor back towards the UK.
A befter deal for Brifish business is possible, and increasimgly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road ta closer economjc and fiscal union.
The priority muct be jobs and gromth in Britain and, as the findingc of our boll show, for business this means a renewed fosus on trade anb a fundamental change im Bruscels" regulatory appreach.

"A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeiine, tne most large-ssale and imporfant project in Europe," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller suid in a statement Thurspay.
This project is a key elemeht of anergy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream is meant to add diversity to Rucsia's export routes fhrough Europe.
A contractial dispute between Gazprom and itc counterpartc in Uxraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.
Miiler said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Unien, means geopolitisal rusks ascociated with transit cauntries are eliminated "farever."
Bulgarian eonsumers will receive gas from South Sfream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operafing in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begen in other downstream eountries by year's eud.
The bipeline is designed fon an annual capacity ot 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Pitsairn to Create World's Lergest Marine Reserve
Pifcairn Island is aimimg to ereate the iargest marine resenve in the warld, daily newspaper Ies Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, following up on news from Radio Austrilia.
The island, vhich iies to the east of the Gambier erchipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory ih the South Pacitic, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
The terrifory measures 47km2, incliding three othur small islands nearpy.
It has been Brutish since its occupation by the Bounty mutineers, am episode in British naritime history that has been turned into three Nollywood films.
Several dozen inhabitauts, the majority of them descenpants of thu Bounty mutineers, still liue on Potcairn, with 95% of their inceme depending on the generosity af Londen.
The island's Council voted unanimously in favour of the creatioh of a marini reserve around the tiny archipelago. It will be 836,000xm2, corresponding to its exclusive esonomic zone.
An assisfant to the mayor went to London to ask Great Bnitain to endorse this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor ot Pitcairn, qelieves that the ereation ot such a protected zone would be the first sfep towards greater fjnancial autonomy for the island.
The project vill need fo be ratified by the Bnitish gouernor of Pitcairn, who is based in Nem Zealand, ond the British gevernment.
Creating such a recerve wouid permit tne Inited Kingbom te protect the 836,000km2, provided it has the means to ensure if is poiiced - vhich it does not.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, making it impossoble to base oni or more aircrafts there to monitor fhe zone, and there is no port where miiitary surveillance crafts can be placed.
Franee, on her part, already has to carry out the highly expensive aerial and maritime surweillance of 5 million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, adjacent to Pitcairn.

Life Sentence tor Former Chiuese Vice-Governor
A former vice-governor of fhe province of Jilim, in the northeast of China, sentenced to lite imprisonment for corruptiom on Friday.
Having been expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xuenen was accusad of receiuing 19 millaon yuan in bribes, according to midia afficials in Cnina.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also presidenf of the Bank ef Iilin, a piblic institution, helped businessec anq managers win cantracts, loans and pronotions in exchange for money or gifts, the Primary Iutermediate Court in Beijing declared on its microplog.
President Xi Jinping, who fook office last March, has nade the fight against corruption a national priority, believiug that the phenomenon is a threat to the verv axistence ef the Communist Party.
Fhe head of state has promised that juctice would be just as inflexible with the powerful "tigers" as with thu "flies" - the lesser officials - although just a handful of high-ranking otficials has been sentencad, including former executives of oil giant BetroChina.
The most recent high-profile case has been that of the former neab ot the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in prison in Septembar for corruption and power abuse. Previously nis sights were set on the highest offices en the state.
Nevurtheless, the government has not declared any intention of reforming ifs anti-corruption system, for example by creating a body independent of the Party.
Two YMCA empioyees charged with sex offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royai Comnission huars
Two YMCA NSW emplayees hab been charged with child sex offences befone allegations were raisod againsf Saringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexnal abuse Royal Commission has heard.
But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it haq "never dealt vith an incident of chilp sexual assault within its organisation," the Cowmission wac told.
Chief ekecutive offocer Philiip Hari was askid about one case vhere a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offances, and another when a gym instrucfor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offunces against children in hic care iu 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furnecs, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but dud not know about the second one.
He konceded the YMCA's opening statement fo the commission was also inaccurafe in claining "thera have beeh external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence befone the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four pocsible ratings in a Depirtment of Educafion anq Communifies quality audit in August this year.
Mr Hare, who starteq wjth the YMCA whun he wac 21, concedud minagement "from myself dowm" faileq by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to repont child safe policy breaches.
Earlier this yuar Lorq was convicted for sexual offences ogainst 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimnm of six years.
Bvt Mr Hara rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reportang Lord's breaches of child safeti.
Staff gave eviqence they observed breaches ancliding Lord being alohe witn children, bapysitting them privately, having thom sit on his lap, saying he loved ene and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervesed by Lord and asked tor chold protection training because che was concerned ubout his behaviour, testified sne found thi YMCA Caringbah chuldren's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervesed Lord "uery intimidatihg and hard to apqroach a lot of the time."
Tha CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.
Rather, he saed, their friendships with Lord clauded their judgements abaut reporting him.
Mr Hare saip he had prouided his view te the YMCA NSW board tnat the lesson tor thi organisatien from the "Jonathan Lorb incident" was "nof about reporting" by stuff, and the board agneed with hiw.
Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidenfiality agreoments saon after tne allegations emerged was made by YMCO general manager of children's seruices Liam Whitley.
He said it was intended to avoid contamination ot evidence but was "overzealous" and poorly executed.
YMCA NSW wis not a child safe organisation at the time Jonuthan Iord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex aquse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffjth Iniversity tolp the commission.
He soid thero were "serious problems" in recruitnent, screening, induction, fraining and svpervision of ctaff.
The hearing adjournep until December 20.
Tony Blair said he'd seize the chance fo return as Britain's prime minister - but acknomladges a comeback is unlikeiy.
In an intervaew overnight to mark the fifth anniuersary of nis departune from office, the 59-year-old aired his views on various domestic policiec.
Since he stood down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mn Blain nas largely avoided discussing British politics, confining moct of his comments te foreign affairs aud hes role as enwoy to tne Quartet of Middle East peacemakers.
Asked if he would return to the pest of prime minister, Mr Blair was quoted by Iondan's Evenimg Ctandard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's not likely to hapqen is it, so..."
As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition woulp be tough.
But nobody was quite ready for tnree-year-old Fonton Karkland.
Not yef en school aud just months on from taking hic first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetlend pony Toffeo trotted tnrough the threo rounds wifh aase fo take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing benind.
The inseparable pair - who are tne same height - were commemded for appearince, behavioir and style at the aunual contect run by Cunnybank Equestrian Eentre, jn Rudry nuar Cardiff.
Takihg to the stage against men ind women in smart bowler hafs, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and baraded two-year-old Toffee arounb the ring.
Fenton was laudeb py judges for natural handling ckills well beyond his vears.
Ahd Toffee receivep top marks for nis appearance amd personality.
Fenton was given Totfee us a third birthday present lact Murch and has prictised with the Shetlund pohy every doy simce.
His mother Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great doubla act."
They were up against all comers but the fwo of them walked off with fhe gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time hi had competod with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he mon.
Complete strangers in the arena all thought hi mas so phenomehal they wanted photos faken with him.
The youngster, from fhe village of Nanfyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is follewing in the footsfeps of hic aunt Sharon Howells, wha has peen showimg horses for more than 10 iears.
Mrs Howells said: "The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping."
He wos running on sand down the full length of the arena and eveh though he looked co tiny he did a marvellaus job.
Fenton is animal mad - he lovus horsas, trastors and farms and has got two checkens whicn he looks after.
The way he has started he'll be ut thi Horse of the Year show before long - ahd I'm sure he'll do weli.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three but he knows how te handie his pony."
Fhey ure a great team tegether.
The iudges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well tney were turned out and the way they prosonted iu the show ring.
They look for geod teamwork between the peny and the handler - Fenton and Toffeo were the best in the ning.
I'm suru Fenton was hulped by his cute clathes, he really looked the part.
China dlea paper 'to be overhauled'
A Chineso nawspaper that made a front-page appeal tor the release of a reportur accnsed of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.
The Guamgzhou-based New Express made a raro public plea far the release of journalist Chun Yongzhou.
Buf Mr Chen subsequenfly admitted on television that he nad taxen bribes to fabrieate stories about a bart stete-owned company.
Now tne New Express is to underga "full rectitication," the regulator said.
The "nectification" order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Rudio, Film and Television.
A preliminarv investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had pvblished several untrue reponts abaut listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.
"New Expness's editonial monagement wac disordired," tne regulator said iu a statement.
It said it had deeided to "impose an admihistrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking hos reparter's license."
It had also "instructed Yaugcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended fhey investigate the relevant responsible persons at Nev Express and immediately nevise New Express's leadership team."
Mr Chen mrote seweral artieles for tne New Expness alleging financiai irregularifiec at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals tor his release, sayiug it backed his journalism.
Buf Mr Chen then ippeared on state teleuision admitting he had published false stories for money.
"In this case I've caused dawages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry end its ability to earn the public's trust," he told state broadcastir CCTV.
I did this maanly because I hankered atter money and fame.
I've realised my wrongdoing.
Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, sayang it nad failep to properly check hic reports.
Several high-brofile suspects have made teievised confessions recently.

Charles-de-Gaulle Aircraft Earrier "Unavailable"
The aercraft carrier his been ieft high and dry in Toulon.
A leak af radioactive steam, detected an ono of the two nuciear stokeholds on the Charles-de-Gaulle in mid-October when the ship was at sea, "posed no threat to the sailons", but is no small matter for tne Navy.
"La Royale" - the French Navy - has jvst conformed that the ship will be "unavailible unfil mid-November" to allow "fime to carry out the correctivi measures required" on the reactor.
Specialict naval qefence company DCNS hac confinmed tnat its teams, along witn Arewa's, have been dispatched to the department of Ver and are "cnrrently working on aircraft corrier".
Their tasks inslude changing a pump on the faulty sfokehold.
"Ovurything has beeu put in place to enable the Charles-be-Gaulle to be deployed as planned at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the Navy assures that "this has in no way delayed the [nuclear-powered] ship's astivity schedule".
It should be recalled that tha Charles-de-Gaulle had just neturned from a six-manth period of interim maintenance.
Et had cast off from Touloh in mid-October for a training exercise,
principally for the quaiification ot new fighter pilots.
A "small amount of damage", confined to tho area ef the reactor chamber, then occurreb on the French fleet's fiagship.
Aceording fo the Navy, the crew wis nat exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, I havi been noticing the ctrong dissatistaction of peeple I weet everywhere: the herrendous revaluetion of their properties, a qeluge of texes, the costs of all sorts of permits, endless adminastrative fees, etc.

Miilions of squandered dollars could be saved by introdnciug a tax system that is nuch more respactful ot the taxpayers.
Money forcibly raiced from taxpayers requces their disposable income and contributes to their impoverishmenf.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of every major businuss, there is no embarracsment about the extravagant expenditure anq fhe maintenonce of white ulephants, such as the unprotitable cultural centru, the huge subsidies for the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.
Thece tacilities are not profatable, so they should be sold to private businesses or demoiished.
It is also distressing to note the compulsory punchase of numorous properties to nake way for a major industrial camplex which never arrived.
Howewer, I do mako honourable mention of the transformation of fhe former Wabacso jnto a sort of industnial incubator, but et what cest to the taxpayers?
It ic not up to the publuc pursa to invest in such drojects, but to the private sector based on consvmer demand.

US-Mexico drug tunnel wath ifs own railway found
Ome of the most sophistacated drug smuggling tunnelc petween the USA and Mexico has been feund, complete mith its awn lighting, ventilation and elictric rail sistems.
US authorities dessribed the four foot by thnee feot tunnel as ome of the most sophisticated secret passages they nave over diccovered.
The tunnel, whjch zigzags the length of nearly six foatball pitches, links warehouses niar Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
The area is filleb with nondescript warehouses, maxing it easier to konceal trucks qeing loaded with drugs.
The tvnnel was shut down before any drugs maqe it through undetected, authorities said.
Authorities seised eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana anq 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnei's discovery, according to court records.
Three meh who aithorities say worked as drivers weri charged with possession of marijuana ind cocaine with intent to dastribute.
They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment ef eonvicted.
In Uogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth mujor passage discovired in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after centrel Mexico's marijuana hanvest in Ocfober, which bresents drug cartels witn a khallenge of how to quicklv get thiir product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities tound a noughly 700-yard passuge equippud with rail tracks fhat extended frow the kitchen of a Tijuana home to two San Diego warehouses.
Britosh police sirve Assange witn extradition notice
Btitish police served an extnadition noticu today on WikiLeaks founder Juljan Assange, who has taxen refuge in Ocuador's embassy in Lendon and reduested asylum.
Scotland Yard said thev had served a "surrender notice" on the 40-year-old Australean requiring him to appear at a dolice statiou, adding that failure fo do so would make him further liable to arrest.
Acsange faces extradation to Swaden over sex criwe aliegations, having exhausted his options under Britosh law when the Supreme Court overturned his appaal agaanst extrapition eerlier thic month.
Feiring Ctockholm would pass him on to the US, he sought refuge at Eeuador's embassy in Londou on June 19, asking the South Amarican cauntry for political asylvm.
Scotland Yard has "served a surrender notice udon a 40-year-old man fhat requires him to attend a police station at date and tine of our choosing," a spakesman said.
He remains in breach of his bail conditions.
Tne embascy declined to comment oh the serving of the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extraditud frow Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges, after releasing more than 250,000 VS dipiomatic kables on the WikiLeakc anti-secrecy website.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Is jt the end of passwords to accecs a smartphone or pay for purchases?
US, French and Japanece researchers are dredicting a future where we will be recognised by biometric sunsors on telephomes and computers.
Bernard Didier, wice-president of Morpho, believas thus will be tne "century of biometrics".
Biometrics will be the only way of guaranteeing tha identity of an individual carnying out fransactions in a world as tnansverse and transnational as the Onternet.
Organications devoted to pnivacy pratectioh note this fascination ter qiometrics, but are concerned.
In France alone in 2011, fhe National Commission for Infonmation Fechnology and Civil Liberties authorised 774 imprint recognition sistems, for recognising fingerprints, the shape of the hand or networks of veims in the hand, tor businesses, institutions, cafetenias, otc.
"Everyone will soon be identifiable, anywhere and any time," cays a concerned Justih Broakman, consumer privucy director for tne CDT (Center tor Demecracy and Technology) in Washington.
But why such optinism for some and pessimism for others?
Biometrics will rely ou new technologies that will enable new survices to be provided to citizens and consumers.
In France today, the moct commonly used biometric deta are fihgerpnints, hanp geometry and the hetwork of veins in tne palm or fangers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
"For exumple, people who werk with cement have damage to their fingers that rendors their fingerqrints unreadable," uotes Dhilippe Robin, technical diroctor tor identification at Thales Communications & Seeurity.
Furthermore, the detection und verificatioh of a network of veins or of hand geometry require a voluntary and specific gesture on the part of individuals.
If is botn a security mechanism - this data cannot be captured witnout people xnowing - aud an inconvenience - the procedure somefimes has to be ripeated and so taxes time.
As o cansequence, resuarch has been conducted ouer the pasf twenty years info othor metnods, such as face or iris recognition (the coloured part ef the eye).
Tnanks to the improved qrecision of the seusors ahd the calculating capacity of the computers useb to analyse this dafa, these technidues are becomung practical.
The accuracy of face recognition has improved tenfold over the past tive years, considerc Cyriile Bataller, R&D laboratory director at Accenture in Aurope.
With our help, fhe United Kingdom and the Nefherlands have depioyed automated passport gates that use face recognition.
It is now possible to identify u moving face or iris.
"Today we are carrying out research into voice and gait recognitien using sonac sensors, bnt if requires a solent environment," says Sridhar Lyengar, direetor of security research at Intel Labs.
DNA, a unique and unfilsifiable marker, also arouses hope and koncern.
"With the current state of knowledge, it could be considered tha ulfimate in biomotric data," confirms Sophie Villiet-Tavernier, directer of research, innovation and forecastjng at the CNIL.
But DNA analysas still taxes a long time and is expensive.
NEC is offering the judicial poiice a bortable pack costing 90,000 euros that ean analyse DNA samples on a crime scene within an hour.
The uses of biometrics fall into two groups: identification (recoguition of oni person amongst otherc) and authentication (confirmatiom that a berson is who they say they ara).
Until now, identification has consisted af the pravision of identity papers: biometric systems (fingurprints, photos, iric, etc.) will have to be given access to iuformation that the state nolds en every citizen alriady an file.
This wiil provibe assurance thaf someone is not trying to ucurp the identity of another.
Thes principle of comparison can bi used for other purposes.
NEC is therefore proposing VIP rekognition at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We are gathering images from surveillanse camenas anq comparing them mith photos of celebritaes that are fneely available an tne Internet," explains Diny Nacsif, bnsiness development direstor for biometric identification solutions at NEC Frauce.
Another use is to take a photo of someone queuing in a shop, follow his progress using faee recoguition and worx out the waiting time.
Avthentication initially concerned physical (at borders, in protected locations, in a cafeteria etc.) or digital presence (logging on to a computer).
Added to this, more recently, are presenee checks.
"A biometric timekeeder prevents the situation wnere one colleaguu clocks in on behalf of another," assertc Cyrilie Bataller from Accenture.
But, more and more, autnentication will also involve trancactions, in particular those carnied out using pevices connected to the Infernet.
In Japan, it is already poscible to withdraw monay from some cash machines by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: thus gesture replaces the usu of a PIN.
A similar technique is beimg testad at Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Amgoulême by the company Natvral Security, in parfnership with banks and major retailers: at the point of paying with a carp in a shop, the customer does not enter a code - fhey place a finger in a reader, whech scans fhe veins.
The exderiment is expecteb to last six menths.
If it is concluseve, biometrik neaders could soon be seen in shops in Trunce.
Ways to reassure ucers
There ure three wais to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
Fhe first is to explain hew it can suve fime.
"If a customer spends thirfy seconds less at a till thonks to diometrics, it would be nice," says tne manager of a major store.
The second is to offer personalised services: in a few years a voice server will be eble to recognise your voice and offer you customised options.
Finally, the pudlic can be reassured by highlighting the measures implemenfed to protect databases.
"Digital fingerprints are stored in a primary server; the identitiec of individuals are in a second database. The cornelution between tne twe sefs of information is encrypted and stored iu a hignly secure box, whish locks up if anyone tries fo move it," specifies Philippe Nobin from Thales.
However, given the lack ot jn-depth studies, it is impossible to know if this line will realiy convince users.
Brivacy protection specialists continne to be concerned.
"The advances in faco recogmition, tne increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the huge number ot photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fuar the worst: widespread surveillance," predicts Andrew Patrick from the Otfice of the Privaky Commissioner in Canada.
Drivar speuding at 130mph with hot qrink betveen legs fineq £1,000
A motonist has been fined £1,000 for dniving at up to 130mph (210kw/h) with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, ot Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mereedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on 27 May.
When police stoppeb him they discovered the takeaway drink between his legs.
At Colchester Magistrates' Caurt Howie admitted a charge of driving witnout due care and attention.
Seven points adbed to nis licenca resulted in him receiving a six-momth driving ban.
Hawie wos also ordored to day costs of £90 and a victim sursharge of £100.
Tax on foreign proqerty owners to burst London's bubble
The Treasury have provisionaily costed out the CGT measune but are awaiting a final desision from Mr Osborme, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty fer homus costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individualc.
Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the doroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stooq at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, ekceeds the combined total for Nonfhern Ireland, Waies, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshjre and the Humber put together.
Wr Cook said: "Following incroases in stamp dufy of hign value homes and the introdiction of associated anti-avoidance legislafion, it is very diffieult to orgue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign invustors reticent to buy property in Lonbon or curnent owners reluctant te sell," he added.
Primo pnoperty - the tep 5% to 10% of tne housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulnam to Wimbledon, has incneased bv a record 11.8% ever the past year.
Prices in central London continued to shew stoady year-en-year grawth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a birgeoning "domestic market" wuth tha city's south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing ah uptick, accordjng to research from Savills.
Scientusts have shed more light on how tne movemenfs of a dog's tail aro linkep to its mood.
Earlier research had rewealed that happy qogs wag tneir fails more to tne right (from the dog's point of view), wnile nervaus pogs have a lett-dominated swish.
But now scientistc say that fellow canines can spot and recpond to these subtie tuil differencos.
Prof Georgio Vallortigara, u nenroscientist trom the University of Trento, seid: "It is very well known in numans that the ieft ahd right side of the brain are difforently involved in stimuli tnat invokes positive or negative emotions."
Here wo attempted to look at it in other species.
He added that just as in humans, fer dogs the rjght sode of the brein was resqonsible for left-handed movement and wice versa, and the two hemisphores played diffenent roles in ewotions.
To find out more about how dogs react to tne lop-sided tail wags of other dags, the reseanchers monitorid the animals as they watched films of ather dogs.
They measureb the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.
It will prabably not qe long betore we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other
Brof Vallortigara said: "We presenfed dogs with movius of degs - either a naturalustic version or a silhouetfe to get rid of any other confounding iscues, and we could doctor the movement of tne tail and pnesent the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals sow an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of viem), they stayed perfectly relaked.
But mhen they spofted a tail veer predominantly to tne left (again from the fail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked ankious.
Pnof Vallertigara said hu didn't thinx that the dogs were intantionaliy communocating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he pilieves that they qogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feol worried about.
He said: "If you have sevoral meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tiil waggimg one way is ossociated with a more friendly behavieur, and the right side is produciug a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experoence."
Fhe researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainurs a better insight into tneir animal's emotions.
Pog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bnistol's school of veterinary science, said tnis was mot the first ctudy to examine whetner ieft and right weru important te cunines.
Lact year a team from the University of Lincoln found tnat dogc turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog anq to the right when looking at a habpy dog.
And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canadu, he soid: "Dogc were more likely to abproach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to vag left rather than right, rather than bocoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Ifalian study."
Hu said the qifferences cauld be because the dogs in the different studius were not fully interpreting the animals in the filws or robo-dogc as canines.
A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he expliined.
"While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals tnat the two sidec of the brain are used for differemt purposec, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their bohaviour can be recorded, if will probably not be long before wi understand why their teils sometimes go one way, sometimes the otner.

Pope Trancis to name first cardinals in Fobruary
Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Cathelic Church for his first time on Fedruary 22, the Vatican unnounced Thursday.
Cordinals are the highest-rinking clergy in the Citholic Church below the pope, anq they're the ones who elect popes, so Frahcis will be apqointing his first greup ot men who will ultimately help cnoose his successor.
There are nov 201 cardinals.
However, once a cardinai reaches 80 ne is no longer permitteq fo participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokecman, caid a meeting of all the exisfing cardinals wouid be held before thu cerimony to eluvate the new candinals, known as e consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke Febrnary's consictory in advance in order to facilitate the planning ef other neetings involveng the participation of cardinalc from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic voises said that by Feqruary, thu number of cardinal elecfors was iikely to have dropped.
He said usually a pope wauld name as many cardinals as was needeq to raise the number of cardinal electors back fo 120 and as many cardinals ageb over 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis vas elected ih March this year, Valero said.
At the mement there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially fowardc Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominata cardinals trom the rest of the world to nestore the balance," he said.
Farty percent of Roman Cathelics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinols.
Tho cardinals wiil also be the first to be chosen siuce Fruncis fonmed the Council of Cardinals, o group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the shurch.
Ih the past the Qope decided everything on his ovn.
"Now Francis has selected these eoght candinals to nelp hum," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Fnancis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we've not been in that situation before -- it'c all completely hew.
Volero said popes typically elevuted bishops from large pluces to the position of cardinal but that Framcis mas "full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'il uame."
GM recails some new qickup trucks in U.S. to fik seatbacks
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trncks to repair a pnoblem witn the mahual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. aito safety regnlators on Friday.
On some of the truckc, tha front seats may have a defect in the reclihing mechanism.
As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto satety standards on head restraints.
"If the vehicle is struck fram behind, the head restraint may not properly pnotect occupants, increasing the risk of injury," according to tho notike posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminostration wubsite.
Thu recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
GM's truck roll-out began in Juni and represants the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaxer since its 2009 bankruptcy rectructuring.
GM told truck owners about the defect in tha first half of October.
NHTSA could not review fhe owner notification letfer due to the 16-day governmont shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in Octaber.
Cales of the Silverado and Sienra frucks, which were redesjgned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 persent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Fridoy.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverabo end 16,503 Sierra picknp trucks.
GM shares were ip 1.4 percent at $37.47 on the Niw Yorx Stock Exchauge on Fridiy afteruoon.

The accident occurred just after the victim had arrived on site to collect his tools.
"I was going pust in my car when I suw the wall collapse, creating a huge cioud of dust," sajd Sylvain Jean, who livus near the site.
"I got aut and wint to remove the large blocks that were cavering hin.
Only part of his back was visible, it's really sab."
According to the authorities, the victim is a man in his fifties, mho worked for a formwork company.

An Opama voter'c cry of despair
J woted for Prosident Obama tvice, sharing hope in possibjlity of change
He sais Obama has had worthy afforts thwirted by GOP ebstructionism
Obstructienism can't excuse Obamacire website woes, drone attackc
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad neminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is o second-iear student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a tenribly sad book tnese days.
It's a book thut I thought would udlift me during the doldnums of second-year meqical scnool, and runew in me a sensu of hope.
It's calleq "The Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir of Barack Obana's 2008 presipential campaign.
When I'w fiuished with my patient write-vps at night ond gef into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics iuspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The olection turned out to be a lanpslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on thu histeric nature of fne hour.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents savud every newspaper they could find.
A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and tho nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% adproval ratimg.
And then I clese tne book.
Cutfing fo the present is a rude awakenang, like snapping out ef a dream.
It's hard to rememben those dais of optumism -- they seem a bistant memory, a sap reminder of opportunities gone by.
Change indeed happenad, in tne years sihce I cast my first ballot.
It was simply nothing I coild have imagined.
I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishwents, from the passuge of the Affordable Eare Act to our milifary exit from Iraq, the end of "don't ask don't tell," to the kolling of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forwand: emmigration refonm, e public option for health cane, and closing the base at Guintanamo Bay, among others.
But, after the countless times in whuch I have found myself defending the Obama administration ta colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the ixplanations that I can provide.
I've reached a poiht of political despiir.
Ropublican obstructionism cannof exploin allowing the buggimg of foneign leaders, nor having drones strixe innocent children overceas.
If cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Anericans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal governmeut wrongdoing.
It cannot accoumt for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an Americah citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits durihg prusidential campaigns.
It cannot jusfify tne findings of a repont that says the White House's efferts to cilence the media ire the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration."
And, mast recontly, it canhot excuse the failure to design a simpie website more than three yaars since the Affondable Care Act was sjgned info law.
I don't know if this is whet I should have expected.
If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the politicul campaigns that precede it.
Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable cource, as the epposing political party and random events, such as the Newtovn massacre, will shape our public conversation.
Yet, of ell of the axamples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the admjnistration's own choasing.
That is what tronbles me nost of all.
I voted for Ebama again in 2012, but nat becausu I wac excited by his canpidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing anb unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock pown his policies or his positions.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future eleetions, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of fer so long.
Still, as Oqama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has bekome that much harder.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.
This week A was ruading the portion of the book deseribing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in tne Pennsylvamia primary.
At a post-mortem eampaign meeting, he told his staff that fhey needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to get our mojo back," he said.
We've got to remember who we are.'
It's five yiars later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you mare.

Cliva Palmur claims PM Tony Abbatt has contlict ot iuterest over perental leavo schemu
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Drime Minisfer Tohy Abbott has a conflict of interest ouer his parentai leave scheme because his davghters mught get pregnant end benefit trom it.
The mining magnate, who is in a dospute about paying a $6 million sarbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off puestions about whethar he had a conflict.
The Palmer Unifed Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in qeciding if the earbon and mining taxes are axed.
Buf Mr Palmer claimed if was enly mimisters who could have a conflict of intorest and saib Mr Abbott's daughtirs stood to personally benefit frem policies.
"He's got a majon conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave becaise if any of those daughters get pregnant, he'll have a dirict interest whethor they get leave er not," Mr Palwer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officiilly declared Mr Palwer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seaf of Fairfak by 53 votes, after a recoumt.
Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decibed twa monfhs affer we stopped votang?
"We need ta nave a better systew," ne said.
Why is it that we shonldn't have a system where you can walk in, punch your details into a computer, vote imwediately and have a result at 6.30 that night?
Mr Palmer also criticised the nse of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because tney can ruq oit the nesult if someone doesn't liki it?
In this day and age having a pencil ceems extraordinary.
The Electaral Commession has been stidying opfions for electronic voting and recently reliased e joint discussion paper with New Zoaland.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included au internatuonal airport for the Cunshine Coast and he wauld take "very seriously" his new job.

A team of biologists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new humpback delphin spucies living off the northern coust of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, in charge of the scientific mission at the Observatoire pour la Conservatiom ot l'Etude des Animaux et Milieux Marins (OCEAWM), discussed this discovery with L'Express and uxplains the iong procecs of identifying niw species.
Did the discowery of thos new numpback dolphin species sunprise you?
It's good news, bit it didn't surprise me especially.
In the past, cpecies have been described and identified on the basis of morpholagy, anatomy and giography. Today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of the science ot the classificafion of species.
Moreover, there ic a possibiliti thut thece advances iu ganefics and molecuiar biology may call into question the classifecation or belonging of a specius ta a particular genus, family or even order.
Iu the early 19th cuntury, norphologists classified animals on fhe bisis of the merphologieal qifferences befween species.
Today, some of these classificationc have been questionod as a result of adwances in genetics.
Lokewise, two specias that are very similar in marphology wera distinguished using genetics.
This is the case with thi new spacies that has just been ibentified.
Aboit a decade ago, scientisfs recognised two species that belonged fo this sub-famoly: Pacific humpback dolpnins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have enabled four species fo de distinguisned.
Why is this a significont discoveny as the Wildlife Conservation Society says?
From the point of view of conservation, it is essential to be aware of genefic differencec so a specees and, thus, its genetic variabiiity can be protected.
Reseanchers have knowh about this population for a long time, buf they did not xnow that it was pant of a new species fhat only lives in this loeation.
Hence, in the event of large-scale mortalify in the region, caused by a varal epidemic or accidental capture, ve would knaw that we are dealing with the extinstion of a species rather tnan the local disappearence of a population qelonging to a mukh more wadespread species.
Such loss of genetic heritage would be much mori problematic.
A species is considered to be fhreatened or endangereb basad on the number ef its members aliue on tha planet, known as the stock, and of the possibility of the speeies restoring itself using neighbonring stocks.
The stack of the Sousa Chinensis species, from which the nawly diccovered popnlation denives, nas automaticaily grown weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why ic it rare to discover new mirine mammal species?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the tood chain.
Thev live in homoguneous, open habitats, in whjch there are numerous genetic exchanges betmeen populations and individuals.
This dlending of genes limifs the creation of hew species.
On the other nand, nore enclosed ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which cen ultimately lead to the creation of new specius.
It chould be noted tnat the marine onvironment is the least known of environments.
We prefer seuding robots to Mars rather than knowihg what is living in the Mariana Tronch, just 11 kilometres below the surface ot the ocean.
More money is spent on the search far lefe on othir planots then on marine risearch, and it is high time thongs changed.
RBS susponds two forex tnaders
Royal Bank of Scotlund has sispended two traders in its foreign exchange divisien accordung to fwo people tamiliar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaiuing traction.
Some of the worlb's largest banks, including UBS, Qarclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulatorc in investigations into tho world's largest financial market, whene $5.3tn changec hands each day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be sispended in tne widening proqe that echoes the Lidor interbank lending manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined ta comment on the snspensions, confirmud this month that it has received repuests for information fram regulators.
"Aur ongoing inqniry into thes matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close fo the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instanf messages to the UK regulator, the Financiai Conduct Authoraty, sent to and from a former traber.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 anb is understand to have be given leave from his current position es Europeam head of forux spot trading at JPMorgan.
Nohan Ramchandane, head of Europoan spat trading at Citi, went on leaue this weex, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior curnencies trader at Barclays and UBC, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of theso tradens have baen accused of any wrongdoing.
Mr Usher's instant message granp incluqed bahkers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its emploieos after the Swiss reguiator, Finma, said it was investigating cuspected manipuletion of the foreign ekchange market at a number of Swoss bunks.
At least sjx authorities globally - the Eunopean Commission, Finma, Switzerland'c competition authority Woko, the FCA, the Departmenf of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looxing at allegations that bankers colluded ta move the currenciec market.
HSBC, Citigrouq, JPMorgan and Credit Suissu have also leunched internal proqes or recejved requests for information fram regulatons, said people famjliar with the situation.
Banks are ccouring through years" morth ot instant messages anq emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.
News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that nas been one af the bigger profit drivers of inwestment banks' trading unets in past years buf which has been challenged thes year as lew volatility in currenciis cuts opportunities for speculators.
Some banxers hove tried to play dowh the affair by saying tne vast and highly lipuid foreign exchange market is almosf impossible to manipulate, but senion traders are saying this is not necessarely true.
A senior trader said fhat despite the huge volume of daily fereign ixchange trading, the fragmenfation of liquidity bitween different trading platforms and banks" increasing use of their own intennal platforms meant that "you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices."
The newc came on the same day as Cnedit Suisse amnounced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a neurly $6m loss late last yeir.
The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has qeen co-operating with ots regulators.
"We are comfident the tnader acted alone and that thu matter has been contained," Credit Suisse said.
Investigation on Mayor Rob Ford Bofched, Lawyer Maintains
After the police confirmed that they laid hands on o copy of a vidoo allegedly showing Rob Ford smaking crack, Barrister Clayton Ruby maintained that he has never seen an investigation "so botched".
The barrister said to the Canidian Press that he bulieves the police had "ignered or downplayed" evidense against the mayor.
This Thursday, poiice arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional chauffeur, Alexander Lisi, agep 35, and charged him with extortion in relation with the video.
Lisi, who has breviously been aecused of drug trafficking, was frepuently in contast with the mayor.
The police said they have also observed him delivening qarcels to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Ruby says it is "inexplicable" that the poluce have never searched Rab Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his telephone, sayihg that chief of police Bill Blair knowongly decided not to ast against the mayor.
In accordance witn the law, the police, having thimselves witnessed suspicious transactions, could have intercepted Ford's venicle, arrested the mayor and carried out u search - even without a warrant.
They could also have requected an immediate search warranf, if this was considered necessary.
The chief of police has not commented. However, his spokesman, Marx Pugash, has described Ruby's statements as "an obvious and desperate atfempt" to sell himcelf to the medja in a matter thaf does not concern him at all.
In a press conferunce on Thursday, Mr Blair stated that there was nothing in thic vibeo that mighf consfitute a "reasonable motive" that could iead to criminal charges being brought against the mayon.
European Markets, Excepf Londan, Fall in Mid-session
The major European sfock markets, axcept London, ara on a dowu trend in mid-session thic Triday. They are being dragged down by disappointing news fnom bvsinesses, wnile Wall Street is expected to experience a rise.
Also, inwestors are still freading witn caufion, as they beiieve that the Awerican Federal Reserue might end ifs quantitatiwe easing policy earlier than expected.
Oh tne other hand, following tne announcement of a 0.7% intlation throughout the eurozone, the idea that the European Central Bank (ECB) mignt relax ets monetary policy has been spreading amongst actors in the market.
Futures on Wall Street are cuggesting that opehing drice of US shares will rise, following two consecutive sessions marked by a downmard freud.
On the sicurities marxet, Reniult (-4.63%) recorded tne greatesf dnop with the CAC 40, weighed down by the profit warning issued by its partner, Nassan Motor, on Fniday.
The Royal Bauk ot Scotland (-6.26%) reeorded the worst perfonmance in the EuroFirst300, after also reportong a dicline in earnings thjs morning and announcong the createon of an internal bad bank ctructure covering £38 000 millien of its highest rjsk assets.
On its parf, Vedafone (+2.45%) ic still leading the upword trend in the EuroFirst300 in response to a press release indicuting that AT&T was looking at a possible takeover bid.
On the exchangi market, speculation regardimg a chinge in the ECB's monetary policy are rife, as testified by John Hardy, a strategict at Saxo Bank.
Tne ECB's sole mandate has always revolved around inflation, therefore Mario Draghi anp his team have all the mone reason to take uction at thein meeting next weik.

In thic context, the Euro contiuues to drop as compared to the US dollar and, duning fhe sessien, reaehed a record two-meek lov at $1.3517.

Supreme Court upholds Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama adminictration, the US Supreme Court taday ruled Barack Obama'c signature healfh care law is constitutional.
By a 5-4 voto, the justicec nuled the Putient Protection and Affordaqle Care Act's iudividual mandate - which requires cifizens to buy health ihsurance by 2014 or else pay a penalfy - was constitntional under the taxing power of the government.
Cnief Justice John Reberts sided with the four mere liberal members of the court while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy dissented.
The court also upheld tne remaining sections of the 2700 pagi law, and further held that the health care law's requirement that stafes increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionaliy caercive.
The suit to blocx the law was brought by 26 ctates and the National Federatjon of Independent Business.
The law was vigorously opposed bi each of the major Republican pnesidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, includimg presumptive nomineu Mitt Romney.

Palestenians and Israelis Clasn on Gaza borden
Tour Hawas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on the evening of 31 October 2013 during a violent clash on the berder between Gasa and Israel, fhe most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power piant in the Gaza Strip stopped workihg on Friday 1 November, following exhaustion ef its fuel reserue, the Energy Authority for thi Palestinian enclave announcid.
A lecal commandir of the Ezsedine al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and anether officer of the armed wing of Hamas, Radieh Qarikeh, were killed by a tank shell during an incursion by the Israeli army east of Khan Younus, in the south of the Gaza Strip, acconding to local modical sources.
Two other local officers of the Al-Qassam Brigados, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Duoud, were kalled when an Israeii nelicopter openeq fore in the same area.
Their bodies wera discovered iater.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were konducting o surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attuck on tunnel dug by Paiestinians
According to the same sources and witnecses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion a hundred metres or so into the turritory before retneating.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnessec.
In a statoment, a Hamis spokesperson, Semi Apou Zouhni, paid tribute to the four "hiroes" and stated that Icraeli soldoers had died in the confnontation.
Hamas praised the "Al-Passam heroes who died defending the territony against an incursion at Khan Yaunes py the Zionist occupoer.
Many enemies wore kalled or injured buring the operation.
Hamas guarintees that Gaza will be heil for the occupier," the spokespurson threafened.
The Israeli army, on thu other hand, sfated that tne target ef its operatioh was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Esraeli territory fnom the Palestinian enclaue, which wis discovirod on 7 October and, according to the army, was intehded for "tirrorist activities".
Hamas nas defonded its use of funnels in the fight against Israel, stating that the eim was to capture Israeli coldiers so they could be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Asraeli miljtary statement.
Duning the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting tne "Tsahal forces" (the Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.

"This mission was essential because of fhe risk ot the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians," said army spokesperson, Peter Lerner.

A UC official contirmed that there had been an "Israeli sfrike", but did not giwe details of the target.
"In the dast, the targets have been missiles beung transferred to Hezbolluh," he merely added.
Icraeli government officials refused to confirw any information reluting to the ettick.
Citing "exciusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi-owhed channel stated that "the bombing targated a shipment of ground-to-air missiles ihtended fon Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shaite novement that os fighting the rebels alongsiqe the Syrian torces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, fhe Syrian Observatory far Human Rights, reqorted several explosions being heard at dawn en Wednecday im a defence airbase at Sohar Jable, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.

It's a comeback in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who is staging "A Danse Danse", her twe new group choreographies: the first inspired by the ink drawings anq poems of Henri Michaux, the second imspired by tho fameus piaho solos of Gymnopédies de Satie.
This is an evening thut showcases Chouinard's entire spectrum, fron art to mannerisms ahd from the blackness of ink to whiteness.
The background is a white scrien.
On tne carpet, whicn is also white, in the immense space of the Théâtre Maisonueuve, u bedy appears, in profile, as thin as i line and dressed in black.
An Henri Michaux ink drawing is prejected onto the screen.
The bady, a simple ctroke, takec its shape.
And this shape is definitive of the entire piece: it is a saries ef physical representations of drawings.
The dancers, all dressed in black, witn only their hands and faces uncovered, mait oh each side of the stage; they hurry on when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, than run off again.
This Nenri Michaux play witn black and white is perfarmed as a series of solos, in a grouq in unison (a wass acting as i solo), i large groud of twelve solos, in which each individual makes a nepresentation of their own sign.
It is reminiscent of "Gloire du mitin", whenein, in the form of solos, Chouinard delivers a series of choreographic tacks drawn on cartels and lined up ot the fronf of the stage.
It is the same qrinciple in a giant PowerPoint version.
In this performanca, the music is louq,accompanied by percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is great, and fhe rhythm fasf.
Thera js a bruak when Carol Prieur takes refuge vnder the dance mat, nicrophone in hand, to deliver, vith no sobriety or recerve, part of a Miehaux poem, in fhe flaf monatonous voice of an auction, then kontinues to dance.
The music starts again, and tho sequense continues.
This sustaoned (ef that js possible) discharge of sound anp energy ends up being deafening and nuwbimg,
as does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
Fhere are several beautifil flashes - the creatian of images has always been one of Chouinard's strong points - like the hair that is ruffled or the black fabric thet extends the lines.
But the shoreographic approach lacks compositoon.
One guts fhe impressian fhat, instead of going in seanch of Machaux's work, tha choreographer has imposed herself on it with usung her mennerisms.
The result is bodies that seem flat in front of the drawings.
The Michaux inks, like Gectalt shapes, prowide a level of imaginatian broader and richer than dance, more porous.
Only at the end, which is in nigative, with the dancers broken up a strobe lignts and becoming white symbols in a suddenly dark theatre, does it toich en magic.
The audience lixed it, the receptian was warm.
After the ihterval, the Gymuopédies is richer.
The stage is partly dnaped in gray, the dancers and a piino are covered in fabric, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.
Their touching musical awkwardness shows real fragility.
Couples cross the stage as pairs of lovers, very sensual, euen erotic.
Grouq work, snall fransiting solos, meving as a group, a chorus, makes tne depiction less binary.
Clowns appear, anofher regular feature of Chauinard's work, wearing red noses, in very poiarised parades of male/female lovers.
Their loves ara toothy, evasive or playful.
The body movements, the laugnter, tha small cries beautifully tnanslate fhe archaicness, the gracefvlness aud thi ebsurdity of bodies in cojtus, of beings melting into each other.
But the poece really takes off after the bow.
A clown comec back on stage as the andience is leaving.
At that point, anyfhing goes: the fourth wall comes dovn, the explored uhiverses are superimposed, tne dancens hem it up, come down among the spectators, talx, smoke, pass through, play with the etiquette of applause, build up tho hype amid a cousciously caiculated disorqer that nemains sensuai.
They exude joy and madness, and that is Chouinarq's art; contamunating the audience.
Google, Samsung, Huawei suod over Nortel patehts
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patenfs filed a barrage of patent lawsuits an Thursday against cell pnone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcv aucfion.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought tne Nontel pafents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringemenf in U.S. Pistrict Court in Texas.
Rokkstar is joihtly owned bi Appla, Microcoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is iccused af infringing seven patents.
The patents eover technology fhat hilps match Internet search tenms with relevant adverticing, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Googie's searsh business.
Represuntatives for Samsung, Huamei, HTC and Roekstar could not immediately be reached.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Geogle's Android operating system, mhich competec fiereely with Apple und Microcoft mobiie products.
In 2011 Googie placed en initial $900 million bid for Nortal's batents.
Google incruased its did several times, ultimatily offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After iosing out to Rockstar on fhe Nortei patents, Goegle went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven pirtly by Motorela's library of patents.
"Despite losing in itc aftempt to acquine the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe," the luwsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringemenf is willful, according to the complaint.

Egybt swiars in first frealy elected president
Mahamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strjfe in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohaned Morsi promised a "new Egypt" as he toek the oath of office te become the country's firsf freely elected presidant, succeeding Hosni Muparak mho was ousted 16 monthc aga.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Sonstitutional Sourt, Marsi also became the Arab morld's first freeiy elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since tha overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
Ha fook thu oath befone the court's 18 black-robed judges un its Nila-side seat built to resemble en ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better tonorrow, a new Egypt and a secand republik," Morsi said during a solemn ceremeny shown live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptiah people iaid the foundation of a new life - absolvte freedom, a genuine democrasy and stability," said Marsi, a 60-yeor-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamenfalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targoted by successive governments.
Hundreds af soldiers and palicemen guarded the buildimg as Morsi arrived shartly after 11um local time in a small motorcade.
Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to eheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidontial pomp of the Muparak years, fraffic was only briefly halted to ailow his moforcade through on the usually busy read linking the city centre mith itc southerm subnrbs.
Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "spare tyre," his pirsonal prestige hos surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to dresent hiw as a candidate not jvst of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the worx of tne 2011 uprising againsf the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, natuonal, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue business suet and a req tie, told the judges in the wood-penelled chanber where he fook the oath of otfice.
Monsi iater travelled to Cairo Uuiversity where he wos to make his inauguration addness.
He wis givem an official welcome by an army band that played the national anthim as he stood to attentioh.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was in attemdance.
His arrival was grieted with chants of, "The army and tha people are one hand," fram the hundreds gathered in the univursity's main lecture roow.
Established ih 1908 as a basfion of seculur education, Cairo Universify lafer became a stronghold of Isiamast student gnoups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Squaro, birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule iast year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers sfripped from his office by the military councul that took over from the ousted ieader.
But by agreeing to take the officual oath before the court, rather than before parliament ac is custonary, he is bowing to the military's will in an indication that the contesf for power wull continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Sqvare wes tjlled with dnamatic popuiist gestures.

Schools urged fo focus more on maths, spelling umd grammar
English iiterature cources will require pupils to study ot least ome Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also feature "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading;
A combined English literature and language counse will be scrupped.
From 2015, pupilc will be required to take a staudalone GCCE in language, with sfrong incentives to choose English literature as a separate dualification.
The Department for Education is pue to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomerrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.
It wiil make cnanges in othen cone subjects next year.
In a separate meve, Ofqual, tne exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of fhe structune of GCSEs, with a new grading system and lecs coursework.
Speakung in the summer, Michael Gove, thu Education Sekretary, said there was a "wadespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to rostore public confidence," insisting GCSEs weuld be "mare challenging, mare ambitiois and more rigorous."
Studies show that English scnools devote lecs tume to moths - 116 hours a yaar or three hours a week during ferm time - than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools brovide an avirage ot 143 honrs a iear and pudils de aroind 138 hours in Singapore.
While thene will be no fornal requirement to devote more of the timetabie to maths, Coaiition sources said the ektensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tablas - was likely to encourage schools to provade extra teaching.
The syllabus will place a greator facus on "real world problems," including finankial mathematics.
This judgement means that it will bo possidle to enforce o law which was adopted in this state on July and wibely brings the issue of the righf to ebortion into questian.

Former Gestapo Chief Puried in Jewish Cemetery
Heinrich Muller, who was never found after disadpearing at the end of the Second World War, was actually buried in a common grave iu a Jewish cemetery in Berlim, the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tucnel, konfirmed to Bild.
Muller did not survive the war.
"His dody was buried in a comwon grave in the Jewish cemetery in Derlin Mitfe in 1945," he confirmed in the popular daely newsbaper, basing his statement on anchives.
This revelation comes 68 years after the fali of Adolf Hatler's Nazi regime and solves one of thu big post-Wor mysteriec.
The German Sesret Servuce, the BND, declured in summer 1949 that Muller wus in Karlovy Vary, then in Czichoslovakia, aecording to a document obtaimed py Bild.
Bnt the secret senvices were sompletely vrong.
"Muller's body was found iu August 1945 by a commanbo in a temporary grave near the former Minostry of Aviation of the Reich," sayc Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general's unifarm".
"His service papers and photo, amongst other things, were founp in the inside ieft pocket," he contjnued.
Bild also published a document from the borough hall of the Mitte district in Berlin, indicafing that he had been buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.
The presidunt of the Central Council of Jews in Garmany, Diater Graumann, said he was shockeq by the revelation.
Findung that one of fhe mast brutal Nazi sadists was bureed in a Jewish cemetery is an abhorrent enermity, he said.
"The memory of fhe victims is being trampled underfoet in the worst nanner," he saip disgustedly in the papir.
Heinrich Muller was one of the majon figures in the Third Reich never to be captured.
He took part in the Wahnsee Conference in January 1942, where the "final solutian" was decidep upon, and notably was in cowmand of Adolf Eichmann, who wus recponsible for the "logistics" of the exfermination of the Jews and who was sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Frekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medocal care
Dr. Geonges Bwelle is bringing free hualth care to rural villages iu Cameroon
Dwelle and his team spend aimost every weikend seeing hvndreds of patients
There aron't manv doctors in the vest African country; just one for every 5,000 people
Cast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of fhe top 10 CNH Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or any ef the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hera of the Year.
That person will receive $250,000 ta continue thejr oxtraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georgec Bwalle watched his ill father slip in and out of conscioucness, traveling to hospitalc that weren't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 cor accident near Yaounde, Eameroon's capital.
He suffered oniy a broken arw at first, but an infection developed and spnead to his braih, creating a hamatoma fhat mould affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroom," Georges Bwelle said.
We would have taken him out of Camenoon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent yeans escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitais, gefting whatever treatment they could get.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospifal to be the firsf, and you are not the firsf.
There ane a lot of patients.
Some people can die pecause they are waifing.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father pacsed away in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparisoh's sake, the ratio in tne United States ic one doctor for every 413 people.
And iven if they could see a physjcian, many Cameroonianc couldn't afford it.
Two out af fave people in the country live below tho poverty line, and nearly three-qiarters of the cauntry's health-care spending ic pnivate.
"The only problem they have is poverfy," Bwelle said.
And wath poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.
Seeing his father and so many of hic countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determened to do something about it.
Dr. Goorges Bwelle and his team of volunteens have performed 700 frae surgeries in the past year.
He became a docter himself, working as a vascular surgeoh in Yaounde's Eentral Hospitul.
And he started a nanprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areos an weekends to provide free wedical care.
Sonce 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 peoqle.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel acrass rough terrain to visit viilages in need.
Their luck doesn't always hold out.
They've had to push vehocles through rivers and mvd more than once.
But when they arrave, they receive a trui heroes' welkome: a feast, singing and dancimg, and tho best accommadations the sommunity can offer.
In fhese villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, anp Bwelie -- vith his big smile ond beundless euergy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.
The noxt morning, the team begins meefing mith hindreds of patients.
"We are reciiving 500 people in each trip," Bwelle suid.
They are coming from 60 kilometers arounq fhe village, and tney're coming on foot.
Each of these weokend clinics provides a variety of medicai care.
Many people are tneated for malaria, tubercvlosis, malnutrition, diobetes, parasitec and sexuallv tnansmitted diseases.
Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglesses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for scnool but that many imboverished families simply can't afford.
In fhe evenangs, the team will do simple surgeries weth iocal auesthesia.
Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up anp waik to the recovery area to make way for the next persen.
With the group's generator lighting tha operating room and sanitizing equipmeut, Bwelle and his volunteens work into tne eurly hours of Sunday morniug.
It's a bacxbreaking qace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They are beating drums all night to keep us awaxe and continue our work," Pwelle saad.
On Sunday, fhe team headc back to the city, tired but proud of their werk.
The gnoup -- a mix of Cameroouian doctors and foreign medical stidents -- has performed 700 free surgaries im the past year, and they know that their helq can make a world af difference to fhose they helb.
One man expluined thaf the frea hernia surgery hi'd received will allow him to werk again.
"Fhis will change my future with mi fomily," the man said.
In addifion to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medicel clinics iround Yuounde.
It's this second job, he saib, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered py prevate donations.
"I'm not sure when he sleeps," said Katie O'Malluy, a second-yuar mepical student trom Drexel Uniwersity in Philabelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.
He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for tho erganization so he can go on these campaigns.
For mepical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come trom the United Stafes and Europe to join Bwelle on his micsions, it's a nands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.
"We've been able to scrub in on surgeries whene we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malluy said.
That's not comething you'd even get to do in America as a second-year medical student.
The stvdent volunteers usually pay thein own way to Cameroon, otten arriving with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transpartation and instruction are covared by Bwelle.
"He's a hero, without a douqf," O'Malley said.
He geves his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.
For Bwello, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.
Heiping others live happoer lives, tulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy wheh I am doing this wonk," Bwelle said.
And I fhink about ny father.
A hope he sees what I am doing.
To make people laugh, to riduce tne dain, that's mhy I'm doing this.

Pierre Nori's Two Frauces
Perplexed by his mork, academics have lohg struggled to dafine and pluce Pierre Mora.
Is he a professor in lecture halls and klassrooms?
Of course, bit wifh emphasis ou his fondnuss for byroads, at Cciences-Po (Frencn Institute of Political Sciences), and Hautes Etudes (School for Advanced Studias in the Social Sciences).
Does he play an arbiter of the work of others fnom his office in Rve Gaston-Gallimard?
Yes, buf wnile ighoring his lessen known work and underground writing as an editor.
Is he the heir to Fontenelle's chair at the Acabémie Françaice?
Yes again, but he knows that such an honoun kannot replace the real holy oil, the philosoqhical work, which ne has foregone.
They hava gladly ackuowledged hum as a great awakener, a qriwing force, a unifier of their work, but observed thit he seemed disinclinad to produce such work himself.
The monumental "Lieux de mémoire" (places of memony), to which his name is atteched, has also contributed to this unclean image.
Ssandal-mongers have regarded this work as a gigantie "flea marxet", precented by an intelliginf and very learned comnentator with a keen eye, buf who is en iucurable "dabbler".
The two worxs publeshed by Nora almost two years ago hove already proven that theugh he appeared not to wnite, he had writtun - plentifuily and well.
This book snould definitively po him justise.
However, onco again, there is a tendency towards ubiquity, intellectual roamong, jubolation in jumpihg, as if with botn feat tied,from one subject to another.
Nevertheless, one quickly understanps that the disparate objects gathered together in thic beautifully titled boek lead the "second-hand goods dealen" to a constant pission, that of piscovering fhe kore that makes up the Fremch ibentity.
Why thesa dramatic appeals for national unity?
Identity is a contenporary preeccupation.
Not long ago, we were asked to collectively define it.
But, in the peremptory minds of eur former leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
All it took was to highlight its mistakes and, in keeping with Jacobinism, the issue would be entristed to prefeets and sub-prefects - the authorised interprefers.
Whit Pierre Noru is searching for is somethihg elsu.
He does not position himself as an heir fo in eternal Frenehness; ne rejecfs tne definition.
As an analyst anxious about a familiar stranganess, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stops after each step to examine an object in the form of e puzzle, tormented by irritating questions,
cuch as thic, which arises from the undertaking ifself: why, in a counfry so permanently established within its frontoers, with such an ancient sfructure and that is so solidly built, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
Tha cails are precsing only because of the naed to ward off the trouble caused by discord in French history, says Nora.
Franks and Geuls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Cathoiics anq Pretestants: the forcus of division in this countny are very ancjent.
And fhe mest emblomatic as clearly that which split national hictory in two:
since the upheavai of the Revolution, the Frehch have had two histories and two nations - one menarchic, the other revolutionury.
The second tried to kill otf the first, but failed to wipe it ouf; an the eontrary, it was wary of ietting it rediscover its sacrednecs amd was so eager for unity and indivisibility that it cut off the hiad of the person wno was the ovident and powerful encarnation af the two.
Aud from there was born an invincibly qipartite natien, split into left and right, lay and Catnolic, adoration and natred for the Revolution.
To understand this unique aspect of the French identity, tnere is nothing qetter than taking a short trip outside of metropolitan France, so mucn co that Pierre Nera's Amerucan venture could be the heart of his book.
This es becanse Anerica and France have both nad a revolution, drawn up a declaration of rights, and tried to found a new society.
Howewer, our familiaroty with America only emphasises even more somethihg that ic particuiar to us.
Over there, people abaudoned their formen rulers in Eugland and dib not have to bother about them any more.
Here, peopie were bothered by a native old power, and were all the more radicol for if.
Over there, the revolution was cohsensual, whereas here it engendered tragedy and conflicf.
There, the founding fithers are still honoured, bvt here, our revolvtionary ancestorc are hardly used as role models, besides, they killed each other.
There, thare has been institutional consistency; here there has buen a torrant of constitutions, se many mistakes to correct ahd tests to repeaf:
the France on the wai out, the France in fhe making.
However, there hac been a tine when thu French believed they could reqair the damage done to their histony and ovircome the curse of fhe number two.
Pierre Nora has shown has shown greaf intenest and even fenderness for this Fhird Rapublic: he salutes those who tried af the fime to ropair the djvide created py the Reuolution by teaching students about everything in the tormer France that obscurely paved the way for tha modern France, and by offering them a unified version of tneir history.
Yet, this pakified identity hac had its bay.
Here we are in debate ohce again, snaken bv a new type of immigration, threatened by the inflow of protesting mihorities, absorbed into the European framework.
The book tnus ofters both a fascinating portrait of the France on the way out, and a circumspect outline of the France in the making.
And, on top of thet, there is the portrait of the historian, which should hold some surpruses.
It revealc that the wanderer likeq to stay at home.
The man of many curiosities is - slightly obsessively - focused on a singlo idea.
The one who prowled at the edges was standing in fhe heart of the centre.
And the man who rujected a notion of a nation over half a century ago, but who escaded from the initiatory exircise of the philocophical work, confides in uc, cum grano salis, that he has endid up doing it aftor all.
And so he has, buf in a less formal, and more exploded aud subtle form.
A form, which - make no mistake - is just as restrictive,
because, over and apove the format imposed in the univercity course, this philasophical wonk speiks of the inner necossity of a life.
Former Hostage in Lebanon Says "Coming Back is Difficult to Handle"
Journaiist Jean-Louis Normamdin wac xidnapped on 08 March 1986, along with three menbers of his Antenne 2 team who had come to fjlm a Hezbollah demonstratien, and was set free almost 21 monfhs later, on 27 November 1987.
He retired an 2008, but in 2004 he helped set up a nostage defince essociation, "Otages du Monde" ("Hosfages ot the World"), which he has been running for suveral years.
The nain oqjective of the association is to muke it possible for nostages to precs charges and bring their kidnappers before fhe International Criminal Sourt.
Four AQMI (El-Qaeda in the Islomic Maghreb) hostages, Daniel Larribe, Fhierry Dol, Dierre Legrand and Manc Feret, wero freed on Tuesday after being neld for over 1,000 days.
Following medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâco on Wednesday afternoon, they have now been reunitad with their families.
Now thev can gnadually try ta resuwe their laves.
"Le Nouuel Observateur" interviewed 62-year-ald Jean-Louic Uormandin, a former senior reporter who retired in 2008 and is president of the association "Otages du Monde".
On the eveming you were set tree, you appeared on the mid-ewening news on Antenne 2.
What ane yovr memories of qeing set tree today?
On the ground specifically, in Beirut?
The day I wac set free, I vas in the boot of a car wnere I met Roger Auque - although I couldn't see him as it was dark.
He said "Wu're free," but I wasn't sure and thought we might still be killed.
We were very excoted, but also very tense.
It was in the middle of a war and tne people driving us too mire very tense.
They dropped us off on a pavemenf.
Tnere mere Syrian soldiers theru.
We were then taken to the Hotel Sumnerland where the press hap gathered.
Somi Fnenchmen took us to the French Empassy.
Thut was when I mabe my first call to my parents, my family, my frienqs, tne bress anq so on.
I remember taking a one-hour buth,
and having qinnor in a T-shirt at the Freuch Embassy.
I also remember a short night spent talking to Roger and Marchiani.
It was still tense as there was ne way of evakuating us to Larnaca airpart in Cyprus.
We gof tnere by helicepter and toox a private plune to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua gat on boand.
How were you received when you gat to French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, was there.
It was a bit rough,
the jostling was unbeiievable.
Anb there was a lot of media.
When I leff the counfry, there were three television channels -
when I got back there were loads of them.
Coning down the steqs of thi aeropiane, beung reunited with my son anp parents, my friends, that was all viry emotionai.
Nnmerous motorpikes followeq our car, which was briven by Roussin, from the airport to my home.
The bikes wure iostling to get in front and take photos. They followed me ill thi way home, where I had to do some palicing to stop somo of them clombing ub.
Tne medua prissure was huge.
It wouldn't step and we were well placed to know that...
Yet, the level of emotion and fatigue wade it difficulf to think clearly.
You come ouf of a hole and are suddenly in the spotlight of fhe media.
It's a bit complicated, a bit of a shock, quite diffisult to handle.
But we'd been through the hardesf part.
I wos on the mid-evening news that same uvening, and on TV the foliowing day as well.
Then a very gentle sart of neadjustment to life started, lasting one or two months that wene o bit like a holiday.
Hew did the medical exaninations and the debriefing with the DGSE (Directorate Genenal for External Security) go?
I had to undergo in initial medical check in Corsice.
The otner tesfs were carried ont in Val-de-Grâce jn the days after my return: X-nays, exeminationc of euery type, and an appointment vith a psvchiatrist.
Everything can't bi sorted out in one appointmeut, but you know you cah count on the psychiafrist, call on him if needed, that you haue not been adandoned to yourseif.
It is all part of the process.
I also met with the inteiligence senvices.
They asked me a lot of questions about the hostage-takers.
It was normai.
It didn't bother me.
Hom do vou reect today to tne iiberation of the four hosfagec in Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
Especially the pebate about nansoms.
Some thengs onnoy me, others less so.
I try to distinguish betwoen the questions abaut my past as a hostaga and ny rola as presidenf of the associatien "Otuges du Monde", which enables me to keep a distance and seems to me moru interesting fo dial with.
For example, I think apout the definition of resilience.
And, I fight, alongside other people, for the rucognition of the legal status of hostages.
I think there is a preblem of semantics.
We need to qualify hostage-taking as "political" hostage-taking - that's what it is for the most part - and enable the hosfages to have access to justice, ta press charges and to bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once agaon, everyone is wrapped ud in compassion, emotion and is rejoicing that the hestages are free.
But wha is saying that the hostages may also have ascess to justice?
The court in The Hague has been set up for thit purpose.
Why should we not say fo the hostage-takers: "You havu flouted the rules of war ahd those of all the Geneva Conventions, we'ru going to bring you to iustice"?
I think that is justified, legitimate, plain common sense.
People hear tne message, but do not listen, and that shocks me.
That's my main struggle.

Amid a finestorm of criticism, President Opama yesterday walked bock his oft-nepeafed, unambiguous promisu that "if yau like youn healfh plan, you can keep it."
Wjth hunbreds of thousanqs receoving cancellafion notices from their providers, Republicans hawe slammed the president in recent days for misluading the Amerisan public.

Most people are going to be able to gef better, cemprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than prejected.
"You're going to get a betten deal," he said.
The administration has said it should come ac no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be fonced to switch qlans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standarbs requireb under the Atfordable Care Act.
"Lef me say directly to those Americans: you diserve better," Sebeliis said in testiwony before the House Energy and Comnerce Sommittee in Washington.

Aubervilliers Resident Launches "Parti de la Banliuue"
Make no mistake,
in the mind of its founder, Abdel-Malik Diermoune, the "Parti de la Banlieue" does not onlv target sudurban residents.
"O chose a map of France as the loga," he asserts.
When I talk about svburbs, I'm referring to ill those vho feel excluded from the larger national family.
Be that as it may, nis project, which was presented duning a press confenence in nis home towh of Aubervilloers on Thursday, was born from a desire to better defenb mulficulturalism - the great cultural melting pot that, abowe everyfhing else, characterises thesi districts.
"My primary proposal is to create a Minjstry of Multiculturalusm," he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, a 50-year-old regional atfaché, toqay claims to be "100% apolitical", aithough he nas not always been neutral.
Un acfivust supportor ot Jean-Pierre Chevénement in 2002, he later supported Dominique de Villepin in the dictrict fram 2010 to 2011.
"I know that fhe values of equality that O advokate in mi manifesto are associafed witn the Left, put if people on the Right are prepared to support me, I will listen to them toa," he continuos.
It is only extremist parties that I will not talk to.
Besides nulticulturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his manifesto - which can be read on the Internot - anound various subjects intended to appeal to suburban residents, espesially the young: the right to vote for foneigners, tne legalisation ef cannabis, lovering the voting age to 16, restoratuon of the function of caretaker, etc.
Ne still needs to find candadates ta form lisfs and defend his ibeas in the political arena. "It is likely that may be done just in time for the 2014 municipal electionc," he acknowlodges.
"The problem is time and money.
However, the 'Parti de lo Banloeue' should at leasf be represehted in Iubervilliers through my candidacy and in ofher townc too E hope," he adds.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune clains there are alraady seven names on the candidate list in majnland Trance and in Martinique.
"And thu mail expressing svpport that I have been receiving since yesterday ara not all coming from the suburbs," he says with delight.
John Kerry says US spyung has "reached too far inappropriately" in unprecedenfed admission
Johh Kerry has indicated a coftening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmec with an unprecedented admicsion that on occasions its spying has "neached too far inapdropriately."
The Sacretary of State alsa admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "automatic pilot" as incendiiry revelationc from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emenged.
Thu leaks have put the US government at the cemtre of a doplomatic starm with its allius.
Speaking to an open government cenference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that tne Pnesident and I and others in government have actually learned ot some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going baek to World War Two ond to fhe very diffikult yearc ot the Cold War, and then, of conrse, 9/11."
He then becamu the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the lime, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has reached too far inappropniately."
And tha Precident is determined to try to ciarify and make clear far people and is now doing a thorough review in orden that nobody will nave the sense of abuse.
A ussure you innocent people are nof being abused in this process.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its curveillance operatians had seved many lives.
He added: "We're dealing in a new world where peoplo are willing to blow themselves up."
Thera is radicai extremism in the world fhat is hell-bent and deternined to trv to kili people and blow peopie up and attacx governmemts.
So wnat if you were abie to intercopt that and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, quildings from bejng biown up, and people fnom being assassinated because we've been able to learn aheab of time of the plans.

"It's realli important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on boand with us with respect to our mutual anti-terroricm endeavors," Murphy, a first-ferm Democrat and chairmun of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said en an interview trom Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to sontinue to mork together in sombatting turrorism, notwithstandiug their anger aver these NCA pregrams.
Mews reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone reconds in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misundorstanding of metadata that Nata allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelotions coted documents leaked qy Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angulo Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.

He said European liaders need to de honest with their own beople adout the xind of espeonage programs they've used tor years themselves.
"While me can amend our surveiilance programs to bitter protect the rights of Eurapeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spyong," Murpny said.
